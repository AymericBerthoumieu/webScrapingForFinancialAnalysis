At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time. From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.  There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day. Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play. Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider.

As usual the chip shortage still looms over tech companies such as Apple and with the new iPhone 13 release I’m questioning if it was as much of a success and as profitable as the company predicted. I’m not too worried necessarily about the earnings per share, I’m more worried about the outlook of the company for the rest of the year and going into 2022. The majority of Apples iPhone sales occur during the holiday season and I’m not sure if supply will be able to meet the high demand. Personally I feel like there is always the highest jump in iPhone demand every 3 generations due to the general trend of how the average consumer upgrades. Such as with the iPhone 6 to the iPhone X, then to the 13. Apple is amazing and like with many other companies, they have made many advancements and innovations but just haven’t had the chance to benefit from them to the fullest extent financially due to the economic and supply restraints brought along by Covid. The market at the moment is propped up by hope for the future, which I think is fine, it shows that more investors are bullish and in it for the long haul. Therefore I think Apple’s stock might be just fine for earnings and follow suit with the end of the year upward swing of the market even if earnings does not necessarily meet expectations.","Opinions on $AAPLs earnings tomorrow?

Well, it’s now the largest company in the world. The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant. Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to  And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult! Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE. Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical. I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC. AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.😂 INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction. But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals. It’s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think). Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely. Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything? If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. (I am not saying you shouldn’t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult) As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely. With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter. TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults. Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.","The power of cult: Why I think DWAC is primed to move higher and so will other similar cult stocks Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?

2021-10-18 15:19:02.104227,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,150.0,u/Stonkgang_,How To Pick BIG MOVERS 🚀 - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.," The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average “Average daily range” for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it’s shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it’s our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let’s assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip). In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive. Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).   Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it’s potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position. However it’s not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let’s take a look at two names with similar ADRs.    2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.   As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you’re a day trader with a short bias.  One of the large misconceptions with beginner traders are that penny stocks provide a better chance of large percentage/monetary gains. More often that not this couldn’t be any further from the truth. For this example we’re going to compare two speculative names to keep things fair. Both names have almost no revenue and are therefore considered as speculative plays.    Since early February 2021 this stock has been in a downtrend with any moves higher being aggressively sold into. The volume has decreased on a weekly and daily basis which tells us there’s very little attention on the name and therefore it’s very unlikely we’ll see any worthwhile movement soon. There is also currently no hype in or surrounding the sector. It’s current stock price is $5.60 and has an ADR of 4.47% 2. Lithium America. Another speculation name which has received quite a lot of attention across social media and amateur traders, however there’s a huge difference. Firstly the chart isn’t trending lower but the complete opposite as it attempts to break into all time highs. Secondly the volume is increasing which shows attention to the name is increasing and therefore a big move is likely (one has recently happened, we traded it). Thirdly there is a large amount of hype in the sector with similar names also being bought and gaining attention. The current price of this stock is $25.43 and the ADR on this stock is 6.73%   So in this example we have two speculative stocks both with little to no revenue. However the Penny stock NNDM has a downtrending chart, no hype, no volume and therefore almost no chance of breaking out.Lithium America on the other hand has a very strong chart, lots of volume, increase hype and therefore a great chance of breaking out. It’s irrelevant if you have $500 to invest or $500,000 as Lithium America in this example on any given day will provide a larger move and better return than NNDM. Not to mention that the likelihood of the move happening on Lithium America is far greater due to the points outlined.  The ADR can also be used to avoid bad entries using the simple mathematics and change of probability. If you’re looking to get into a name which has had no news, no increase in volume and isn’t set to breakout then you’ll want to avoid entering if it’s already close to 1 ADR. Based on averages and the law of probability it’s extremely likely that in that scenario you’ll be entering at the high of the day. The opposite to this is a strong name that’s holding its trend is reaching 1 ADR to the downside. If all other factors look good then the law of probability states you’re likely buying at the low of the day. On aggressive breakouts and large catalysts such as earnings we can use the ADR to determine where we take profits or when we may avoid a late entry. It's not uncommon for large catalysts like a big earnings beat to provide 3-5 ADR's on the first day. You can therefore once again use the data to determine the probability of continuation and a good/bad entry.  We use ADR to filter out the names which have the potential to provide us with a significant move. However they must also have a clean technical chart with some form of growth and/or growth potential. The ADR is the key number to go by Ideally you want to see a minimum of 3% ADR and ideally something within the 5-10% range.","How To Pick BIG MOVERS 🚀 - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.  The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average “Average daily range” for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it’s shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it’s our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let’s assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip).

2021-10-13 15:19:05.801884,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,22.0,u/MaybeRocketScience,Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging,"Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off. Would like to share my findings and have opinions on how to play this. The hedge fund in question is  I cannot mention the company, as: - based on quick calculations, they never reached the $1.5B market cap threshold, and are hence (appropriately) qualified per WSB rules as ""worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes"". - otherwise every single person on WSB would load up on puts or do whatever shit. Anyway, if you have minimal research skills you'll guess/find what I'm talking about. I'll call it Company X for this post. Company X has no meaningful revenue, and does nothing but lose money. In the management team, there's a guy who recently settled for fraud, for his involvement in another company (which recently collapsed). The stock used to have a total market cap of ~$20M, right now, after massive dilution (5x O/S in a few months), shares are trading higher and the total market cap is ~$650M. Company X has recently engaged in a flurry of M&A, spinoffs and whatever else, creating potential ""catalysts"". It's also heavily promoted by well known Twitter personalities. Not having the cash to fund such endeavors, they started issuing convertible notes. And here Hudson Bay comes into play. The hedge fund offered hundreds of millions $ to Company X in convertible notes with short expiration (note: company revenue ~$2.5M). Other warrants have been offered to them and, to a lesser extent, to other firms. As Company X doesn't make money, but spends a decent bit, they are now asking shareholders to approve early exercise of all warrants.  Very few warrants issued Pointing out that, without that, the company would be in a tough situation (and realistically the M&A activities might be gone):  A little nudge on the vote Hudson Bay Capital would have, including the convertible note, warrants for about 120M shares, which is more than the current O/S total (~100M). Dumping such truckload of shares wouldn't be feasible, with current volumes. Hence, I suspect they are pulling of a magic financial trick called Warrant hedging I know, what the hell is this, who the fuck trades warrants, etc. Warrants are basically call options, but they're issued by the company, hence the money would go straight to them if exercised. Warrant hedging means: - you hold a warrant at $10 - you place a short at $20 - your position is hedged. No matter where the price goes, you locked in a risk free profit. It's also an unsqueezable short, since you can't get margin called. The moment such warrants are exercised, you cash out of your position with $10 in profit, the company cashes in $10 from the warrant, and shareholders are left holding the bag. There are a series of things that make me suspect such strategy is being employed. The first is that the SI has gone nowhere but up lately, despite the supposed ""squeeze"" and the subsequent tanking. It's worth noting that high SI has been recently attracting flocks of retail traders, hoping for squeeze profits. Price action would look manipulated: whenever the share price approaches the warrant level, volume dries up until there's a rebound, often ""catalyst"" triggered. Then huge volume, price goes flat/down, rinse and repeat. HBC can place a de-facto risk free short anytime the price is above the warrants (lowest is $2.655). This leads to a situation in which they could, in principle, short a ton of Company X stock, wake up on the day after the early exercise is approved, and cover their position by exercising their warrants. No messed up price action, which they'd get if they were to dump their position, just a sudden spike in O/S. There are a few instances in which this may not be the case: - HBC actually plans to dump their position after early exercise is allowed. Whatever. - HBC plans to hold >$700M, close to 10% of their portfolio, in a single low cap stock with no revenue and dubious management. This would dwarf their  - shareholders vote against the proposal. This opens up a pandora box of deals falling apart, and potential default, for Company X. Considering that, in principle, the last could happen and create some turbulence, and looking at a SI of ~20-25%, I would think HBC is employing this strategy for a decent chunk, but not all, of their holdings. Last thing to note: the company has placed another ""catalyst"" (spinoff) one week after the vote, possibly to encourage retail not to offload their shares. This was originally planned for the day after the vote, but has since been postponed. It would help the hedge fund dump the rest of the shares. The question now is:  I bought some puts, was swimming in the green, getting hammered this week. Would you think puts for the spinoff week would work? Puts for this Friday? A month from now? And especially, could the warrant hedging just balloon the O/S without any meaningful price action when exercised? In which case, my puts would be fucked? That's all, thanks for coming to my TED talk tl;dr : the Hudson Bay Capital hedge fund is pulling off some serious fuckery","Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off.

2021-10-03 15:19:19.664492,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,153.0,u/nafizzaki,Some common mistakes we seem to make and how not to repeat them [Long post for newbies],"Hello! I am mostly a lurker in here but I do post time to time. And recently, I am seeing an influx of bad rumours or advice that seems to be constantly circling around. So, I hope this post might be helpful for those that are kinda new into degen gambling.  Now, here's some common mistakes or rumours or bad advice that's circling around in reddit:    Also, do understand that if someone says hedgies are manipulating the market or things like that, be very sceptical. Are you sure that the person saying that isn't manipulating you? Are you sure that the person saying that is not some fund manager/high net worth individual influencing you to buy some shitty options that they want to sell? Market is influenced/manipulated by everything. Your buying and selling is also a form of manipulation. So understand this, don't fall for ""Hedgies manipulating this stock, if you buy it, you will stick it to the hedgies"" narrative. We are here to make money through short term positions, not to be manipulated by some idealistic rant.       You will find plenty of free materials online that might help you with it. If I were to give you a suggestion about a book, well, ""Option volatility and pricing strategies"" by Sheldon Natenberg may help you with it.   They work like insurance. If you are making 10% or maybe 500%😂 or maybe even more gains a year, it makes sense that you keep your wealth preserved. If someone is warning doom and gloom, you won't have to lose your sleep, because you know when the time comes, you won't be the  💼 holder.   The market will adjust the amount of special dividend that will be given. An options seller will also adjust the price of the options that you are going to buy. So, special dividend is a zero sum game or a rather negative sum game, cause you might create a taxable event which could impact you in the future.   Did you know that up until 2020, long term treasury bonds outperformed S&P 500 (dividend inclusive) for the last 20 years before that?  Although this trend will not be seen any time in the future any longer as bond yields are just too low. That's why we are finally seeing some inflows into stocks instead of outflows from it.   Taxes have destroyed many a gamblers life. They won money in a play. Sold. Then lost all or some of it in another play, in some cases (not all), you might actually owe taxes to the tax authority that you don't even have. This is a very country and individual circumstances specific thing, so I can't really tell you how best to save on taxes unless I know in detail about your circumstances. But for Americans hope this  Also, to add to this, I have seen probably some very dumb comments of people saying things like ""I would owe more taxes if I make more money that's why I am making less money"", don't be that guy.   You should also ask the question why I am writing this? What's my motive? Etc etc.     Remember, for every time you are buying something, someone else is selling those something. Technical analysis can easily show you where buyer and sellers are meeting the most in a condensed format. Understanding it might help you position, enter, exit and most importantly discipline your trades. Does it mean that you should just follow the cup and handle pattern and buy things? No. It is a tool, much like every other tool a gambler can have in their belt.   To understand CPI, you gotta understand the composition of the CPI. Some say, CPI doesn't include housing consumption, which is laughable.  You might see people use a source like shadowstats, which is essentially a completely flawed website. Here's some reading  Yes, CPI has some flaws, but it is not a sham like people try to make it out to be. If inflation is really 10% or 8%, why are commercial banks lending money at such a low rate? Wouldn't they have become bankrupt within this 2 decade?? Better yet, if you really believe that inflation is something percent, put your money where your mouth is and buy up everything you see in Walmart and try to sell that 1 year later also using the low interest environment in your favour.   Hope this helps in clearing out some confusion and have a nice night. And if you have seen or know about some other mistakes or misconceptions people have, please do share!","Some common mistakes we seem to make and how not to repeat them [Long post for newbies] Hello! I am mostly a lurker in here but I do post time to time. And recently, I am seeing an influx of bad rumours or advice that seems to be constantly circling around. So, I hope this post might be helpful for those that are kinda new into degen gambling.  Now, here's some common mistakes or rumours or bad advice that's circling around in reddit:    Also, do understand that if someone says hedgies are manipulating the market or things like that, be very sceptical. Are you sure that the person saying that isn't manipulating you? Are you sure that the person saying that is not some fund manager/high net worth individual influencing you to buy some shitty options that they want to sell? Market is influenced/manipulated by everything. Your buying and selling is also a form of manipulation. So understand this, don't fall for ""Hedgies manipulating this stock, if you buy it, you will stick it to the hedgies"" narrative. We are here to make money through short term positions, not to be manipulated by some idealistic rant.       You will find plenty of free materials online that might help you with it. If I were to give you a suggestion about a book, well, ""Option volatility and pricing strategies"" by Sheldon Natenberg may help you with it.   They work like insurance. If you are making 10% or maybe 500%😂 or maybe even more gains a year, it makes sense that you keep your wealth preserved. If someone is warning doom and gloom, you won't have to lose your sleep, because you know when the time comes, you won't be the  💼 holder.   The market will adjust the amount of special dividend that will be given. An options seller will also adjust the price of the options that you are going to buy. So, special dividend is a zero sum game or a rather negative sum game, cause you might create a taxable event which could impact you in the future.   Did you know that up until 2020, long term treasury bonds outperformed S&P 500 (dividend inclusive) for the last 20 years before that?  Although this trend will not be seen any time in the future any longer as bond yields are just too low. That's why we are finally seeing some inflows into stocks instead of outflows from it.   Taxes have destroyed many a gamblers life. They won money in a play. Sold. Then lost all or some of it in another play, in some cases (not all), you might actually owe taxes to the tax authority that you don't even have. This is a very country and individual circumstances specific thing, so I can't really tell you how best to save on taxes unless I know in detail about your circumstances. But for Americans hope this  Also, to add to this, I have seen probably some very dumb comments of people saying things like ""I would owe more taxes if I make more money that's why I am making less money"", don't be that guy.   You should also ask the question why I am writing this? What's my motive? Etc etc.     Remember, for every time you are buying something, someone else is selling those something. Technical analysis can easily show you where buyer and sellers are meeting the most in a condensed format. Understanding it might help you position, enter, exit and most importantly discipline your trades. Does it mean that you should just follow the cup and handle pattern and buy things? No. It is a tool, much like every other tool a gambler can have in their belt.   To understand CPI, you gotta understand the composition of the CPI. Some say, CPI doesn't include housing consumption, which is laughable.  You might see people use a source like shadowstats, which is essentially a completely flawed website. Here's some reading  Yes, CPI has some flaws, but it is not a sham like people try to make it out to be. If inflation is really 10% or 8%, why are commercial banks lending money at such a low rate? Wouldn't they have become bankrupt within this 2 decade?? Better yet, if you really believe that inflation is something percent, put your money where your mouth is and buy up everything you see in Walmart and try to sell that 1 year later also using the low interest environment in your favour.   Hope this helps in clearing out some confusion and have a nice night. And if you have seen or know about some other mistakes or misconceptions people have, please do share!"

But what I found extremely interesting is the timeline of the news.  -about an hour later FB and it's other platforms experience an outage -around the same time or within the hour news breaks of the FTC complaints and news relating to the gov't trying to force the sale of insta and WhatsApp. So here's my theory. Also to me this sounds all tin foily but also slightly plausible. So I am reaching out to the apes here that are much smarter than me to help fact check or provide any insight. Or just straight up rip this statement apart if it is a crock of shit. Let's begin. So what I'm thinking is would it be far fetched to assume that these the outage is by no means a coincidence but rather planned? With the news of the whistle blower breaking out what if FB intentionally took their servers offline to either: A. Discretely purge records that would confirm whistle blowers statements B. Strong arm the gov't to drop the suit by blaming them on a future date for the outage and having public backlash force the gov't to back off. Why I think this might be plausible is for anyone that's familiar with the game Eve online it's a game that everyones plays on the same server at the same time all over the world regardless of timezone. Therefore the server is always on except for a scheduled downtime that takes the server offline to allow for patches and updates. Now FB is similar in the sence that it's an always on service and probably operates on the same server or set of servers (my guess I don't know). What if in order to get rid of any back end digital paper trails you would need to edit at the architecture/frameworks/coding etc (developers/dev ops chime in here I'm not one so this is purely speculative). Now in order to do so would that require the servers be offline? Alternatively point b. That one is a little more self explanatory people as we know are addicted to social media so it wouldn't be a far stretch to assume that if FB pointed the finger at gov't or another scapegoat and said they forced us to do it people would get into a fit and the outrage would be fierce since there's already alot of distrust of the gov't. Since we know FB loves their data and consciousness experiments (i.e Russian interference in 2016 election, and no this isn't a political debate so keep your idiologies out of it) but since they have a general sense of what the consciousness of a country or demographic would be thinking it wouldn't be hard for them to spin stories that subscribe to people's narratives. Because as we can all agree people are almost most accepting of stories that best fit their own internal narratives. So again this might be a wild conspiracy theory. I might just be regarded and over analysing so please if anyone smarter then me can fact check this that would be appreciated","whistle blower may have lead to FB outage? theory So I'm sure you've all seen the news relating to FB today so I'll keep this brief.

2021-10-03 15:20:17.188417,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,17.0,u/bestzec,Leave no Buffett behind. A case for $TEVA Pharmaceuticals coming back with a vengeance,"Was banned from the sub for a few days so posting it a bit late here...  Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Generics… Wait no, the company debt Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits Okay there is a room full of elephants and we’re over the weight limit so let’s let them out one at a time.  As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D’s and Wendy’s all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company’s market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I’m mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug… That’s right it’s TEVA. Viagra is clearly not the only drug I’m on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I’m popping them like tic tacs. And it’s the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crpyto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall. Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I’ll be taking that later when I’m ready to go to sleep. Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need. Oh and if you’re not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn’t weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it’s a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I’m talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I’m paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don’t want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital. Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that’s just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA’s revenues comes from generics.  Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you’re not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA’s revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they’ll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today’s prices (This is also a reason why TEVA’s stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.  There’s been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let’s do some ratios. If a giant company like J&J, that’s worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around ~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion. Are there any elephants left? I’m sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.  What’s valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices. You think i’m going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos’s ex-wife’s bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market). Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it’s more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you’re in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I’m coming back for you. What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I’ve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.  Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark. There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They’ve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating. Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That’s right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they’ve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they’ll keep holding for the price recovery. (Not investing advice)","Leave no Buffett behind. A case for $TEVA Pharmaceuticals coming back with a vengeance Was banned from the sub for a few days so posting it a bit late here...  Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Generics… Wait no, the company debt Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits Okay there is a room full of elephants and we’re over the weight limit so let’s let them out one at a time.  As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D’s and Wendy’s all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company’s market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I’m mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug… That’s right it’s TEVA. Viagra is clearly not the only drug I’m on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I’m popping them like tic tacs. And it’s the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crpyto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall. Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I’ll be taking that later when I’m ready to go to sleep. Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need. Oh and if you’re not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn’t weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it’s a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I’m talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I’m paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don’t want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital. Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that’s just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA’s revenues comes from generics.  Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you’re not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA’s revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they’ll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today’s prices (This is also a reason why TEVA’s stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.  There’s been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let’s do some ratios. If a giant company like J&J, that’s worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around ~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion. Are there any elephants left? I’m sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.  What’s valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices.

The actual submission to the FDA will not contain personal or unnecessary information that has been added for context and clarity for a non-scientific audience.    Artist William Utermohlen was diagnosed with AD (Alzheimer's disease) in 1995. In the figure above, he painted what he saw in the mirror. As we can see from his last painting in 2000, he spent the final seven years of his life incapable of seeing the world, effectively blind. He died in 2007. This view of AD from a patient perspective is tragic and touching. It elicits anxiety for those of us with sound minds. What's it like to look into the mirror, unable to see one's own face for seven years? What else are they unable to see? I practice at one of the largest community hospitals in the southeast. As you know, for every 1000 medicare patient days in the hospital, 538 are associated with AD. AD is predictive of an extended and complex hospital stay with increased odds of death (compared to patients who do not have AD).  I have witnessed numerous families bring their elderly father or mother to the ER, saying, ""we cannot take care of him/her."" Not because they are forgetful, but because they are easily agitated and turn aggressive. These families do not ask, ""is there a treatment?"". They have already navigated a complex medical system and know AD is terminal with no effective treatment. Heart attacks, strokes, sepsis, and other diseases seen in hospitals have a myriad of treatments. AD does not. AD is the sixth leading cause, and by some estimates, it is the third leading cause of death. See "" As a patient advocate, I elected to present anecdotal data to contextualize and humanize the numerous awful statistics we all know too well. I review these weighty problems with the FDA to help frame my logic and construct a petition for why Simufilam must be expediently granted accelerated approval and advanced to phase 4 post-marketing surveillance. After reviewing the FDA's mission statement, I am operating on the premise that the FDA evaluates medications based on    Simufilam has been administered to patients across 5 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03748706, NCT04079803, NCT04932655, NCT04388254, NCT04388254). More precisely, 39,620 doses of Simufilam were administered from the publicly available data, with no reported serious  In addition, there are 150 patients enrolled in the ""open-label extension trial"" (OLE). They do not have publicly available information; however, it is reasonable to assume the FDA is privy to safety data. The standard protocol requires study sites to report serious adverse events immediately to the FDA. Those OLE patients were administered another 109,500 doses. .ciVctEeLKylCRejTc9u2e{position:relative;width:336px;border-radius:4px;background-color:var(--newRedditTheme-field);filter:drop-shadow(0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,.2))}.ciVctEeLKylCRejTc9u2e:before{position:absolute;bottom:100%;height:20px;left:0;right:0;content:""""}._2EZJLt05_wdk_osIo3latc{font-size:14px;font-weight:500;line-height:18px;color:var(--newRedditTheme-bodyText);border-top:4px solid var(--newCommunityTheme-active);border-radius:inherit;padding:12px}._2vohvd3sMxCQYU4XZok__A{height:16px;width:16px;margin-right:4px;vertical-align:middle}._3yFC4AlORm5Ql4AnP3tO5C{font-weight:400}.GMu2Q_kdqb93PfujN_OOl{margin:0 12px;height:1px;background-color:var(--newRedditTheme-line)}._2gSXbxrVWkQzb3nXCaQkFh{padding:12px 12px 4px;display:-ms-grid;display:grid;row-gap:12px;-ms-grid-columns:(1fr)[4];grid-template-columns:repeat(4,1fr);overflow:auto;max-height:180px}._3pA5vkTP_ON_VYoG5WY7C8{text-align:center;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;width:78px;min-height:68px;-ms-flex-pack:justify;justify-content:space-between;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:default;padding:0 4px}._3rkJmlv7uPJ7-MXHuj6JR1{-ms-flex:0 0 auto;flex:0 0 auto;width:40px;height:40px}._3YgkxQ3fxaRYFvsTInqamE{width:100%}.JwJGr7w5_BCdexRK2Ge1v{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;line-height:16px;font-size:10px;line-height:12px;margin-top:4px;color:var(--newRedditTheme-metaText);-ms-flex:1 0 24px;flex:1 0 24px;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;justify-content:center}.kXcPoSA0ho3o1nH-mYqEV{position:relative;padding:16px 12px 12px}._1XmrOUyJINsGbV1Emy_6I0{position:absolute;bottom:100%;left:0;right:0;height:60px;background:linear-gradient(180deg,transparent,var(--newRedditTheme-field));pointer-events:none;transition:opacity .1s ease;opacity:0}._1XmrOUyJINsGbV1Emy_6I0._1gcqKximkvdrFYxxOUaH4g{opacity:1}._1q2lrbLX6F7HH2qBbvitLG{text-transform:capitalize}

/*# sourceMappingURL=https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/chunkCSS/UserAchievementFlair.c061794f2bc16d47b471_.css.map*/ Factoring in the OLE patients, in totality,   Data associated with Simufilam has been remarkably consistent. A 28 day multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 64 patients measured:  Cassava Sciences stated:  Open-label Extension data tested:  Tallied up, we have 34 different measures over twelve months and twenty-eight days. Now, let us focus on the data which is clinically the most relevant-ADAS cog, and NPI. A valid criticism of the twelve-month OLE data is that it is open-label, susceptible to placebo effect. However, a more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect highly probable and Placebo effect unlikely.   A  The disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a    A follow-up meta-analysis by  Simufilams ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above:   The data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable. Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. So, if a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-cog at twelve months or greater, this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature. We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below. Taking a closer look at the delta between the above cohorts and the OLE ADAS-cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. By my estimation, this can not be explained by placebo. Suppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes phase three a foregone conclusion, in my opinion.   As mentioned above, behavioral disturbances are the explicit reason families abandon their loved ones in the ER. Caregiver stress is cited in ""Alzheimer's facts and figures"" as having numerous unfavorable outcomes. Worse, physicians are often forced to use antipsychotics for dementia-related psychosis and agitation, which increases the risk of death in the elderly. Restraints (a generous way of referring to tying patients to the bed) are an unfortunate last resort used in the hospital setting to prevent patients from harming themselves and staff. Simufilam use resulted in markedly fewer behavior disturbances, and this data continues to improve with time. Fast-tracking a medication after a single-arm study would not be an unprecedented action by the FDA. As Ke Liu, MD, PhD cites  As is known, the cognitive data was collected over sixteen clinical sites across the US and Canada by independent Physician PI's and associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). The chain of custody was made transparent and verified by independent biostatisticians. AD claims the lives of 13 patients every hour, and if the FDA allows phase three trials to continue for two years, then we risk the deaths of over 240,000 patients. As functional status is an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality. I believe by preserving cognitive function, Simufilam will also preserve functional status (as the two are highly correlated). It may take years to see a mortality benefit, but waiting years in the setting of limited risk is unacceptable. I and my cosigners are humbly and optimistically submitting this Citizens Petition to review m my risk-benefit analysis. I look forward to the FDA's correspondence.

AD is predictive of an extended and complex hospital stay with increased odds of death (compared to patients who do not have AD).  I have witnessed numerous families bring their elderly father or mother to the ER, saying, ""we cannot take care of him/her."" Not because they are forgetful, but because they are easily agitated and turn aggressive. These families do not ask, ""is there a treatment?"". They have already navigated a complex medical system and know AD is terminal with no effective treatment. Heart attacks, strokes, sepsis, and other diseases seen in hospitals have a myriad of treatments. AD does not. AD is the sixth leading cause, and by some estimates, it is the third leading cause of death. See "" As a patient advocate, I elected to present anecdotal data to contextualize and humanize the numerous awful statistics we all know too well. I review these weighty problems with the FDA to help frame my logic and construct a petition for why Simufilam must be expediently granted accelerated approval and advanced to phase 4 post-marketing surveillance. After reviewing the FDA's mission statement, I am operating on the premise that the FDA evaluates medications based on    Simufilam has been administered to patients across 5 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03748706, NCT04079803, NCT04932655, NCT04388254, NCT04388254). More precisely, 39,620 doses of Simufilam were administered from the publicly available data, with no reported serious  In addition, there are 150 patients enrolled in the ""open-label extension trial"" (OLE). They do not have publicly available information; however, it is reasonable to assume the FDA is privy to safety data. The standard protocol requires study sites to report serious adverse events immediately to the FDA. Those OLE patients were administered another 109,500 doses. .ciVctEeLKylCRejTc9u2e{position:relative;width:336px;border-radius:4px;background-color:var(--newRedditTheme-field);filter:drop-shadow(0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,.2))}.ciVctEeLKylCRejTc9u2e:before{position:absolute;bottom:100%;height:20px;left:0;right:0;content:""""}._2EZJLt05_wdk_osIo3latc{font-size:14px;font-weight:500;line-height:18px;color:var(--newRedditTheme-bodyText);border-top:4px solid var(--newCommunityTheme-active);border-radius:inherit;padding:12px}._2vohvd3sMxCQYU4XZok__A{height:16px;width:16px;margin-right:4px;vertical-align:middle}._3yFC4AlORm5Ql4AnP3tO5C{font-weight:400}.GMu2Q_kdqb93PfujN_OOl{margin:0 12px;height:1px;background-color:var(--newRedditTheme-line)}._2gSXbxrVWkQzb3nXCaQkFh{padding:12px 12px 4px;display:-ms-grid;display:grid;row-gap:12px;-ms-grid-columns:(1fr)[4];grid-template-columns:repeat(4,1fr);overflow:auto;max-height:180px}._3pA5vkTP_ON_VYoG5WY7C8{text-align:center;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;width:78px;min-height:68px;-ms-flex-pack:justify;justify-content:space-between;box-sizing:border-box;cursor:default;padding:0 4px}._3rkJmlv7uPJ7-MXHuj6JR1{-ms-flex:0 0 auto;flex:0 0 auto;width:40px;height:40px}._3YgkxQ3fxaRYFvsTInqamE{width:100%}.JwJGr7w5_BCdexRK2Ge1v{font-size:12px;font-weight:400;line-height:16px;font-size:10px;line-height:12px;margin-top:4px;color:var(--newRedditTheme-metaText);-ms-flex:1 0 24px;flex:1 0 24px;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;justify-content:center}.kXcPoSA0ho3o1nH-mYqEV{position:relative;padding:16px 12px 12px}._1XmrOUyJINsGbV1Emy_6I0{position:absolute;bottom:100%;left:0;right:0;height:60px;background:linear-gradient(180deg,transparent,var(--newRedditTheme-field));pointer-events:none;transition:opacity .1s ease;opacity:0}._1XmrOUyJINsGbV1Emy_6I0._1gcqKximkvdrFYxxOUaH4g{opacity:1}._1q2lrbLX6F7HH2qBbvitLG{text-transform:capitalize}

/*# sourceMappingURL=https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/chunkCSS/UserAchievementFlair.c061794f2bc16d47b471_.css.map*/ Factoring in the OLE patients, in totality,   Data associated with Simufilam has been remarkably consistent. A 28 day multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 64 patients measured:  Cassava Sciences stated:  Open-label Extension data tested:  Tallied up, we have 34 different measures over twelve months and twenty-eight days. Now, let us focus on the data which is clinically the most relevant-ADAS cog, and NPI. A valid criticism of the twelve-month OLE data is that it is open-label, susceptible to placebo effect. However, a more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect highly probable and Placebo effect unlikely.   A  The disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a    A follow-up meta-analysis by  Simufilams ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above:   The data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable. Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. So, if a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-cog at twelve months or greater, this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature. We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below. Taking a closer look at the delta between the above cohorts and the OLE ADAS-cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. By my estimation, this can not be explained by placebo. Suppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes phase three a foregone conclusion, in my opinion.   As mentioned above, behavioral disturbances are the explicit reason families abandon their loved ones in the ER. Caregiver stress is cited in ""Alzheimer's facts and figures"" as having numerous unfavorable outcomes. Worse, physicians are often forced to use antipsychotics for dementia-related psychosis and agitation, which increases the risk of death in the elderly. Restraints (a generous way of referring to tying patients to the bed) are an unfortunate last resort used in the hospital setting to prevent patients from harming themselves and staff. Simufilam use resulted in markedly fewer behavior disturbances, and this data continues to improve with time. Fast-tracking a medication after a single-arm study would not be an unprecedented action by the FDA. As Ke Liu, MD, PhD cites  As is known, the cognitive data was collected over sixteen clinical sites across the US and Canada by independent Physician PI's and associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). The chain of custody was made transparent and verified by independent biostatisticians. AD claims the lives of 13 patients every hour, and if the FDA allows phase three trials to continue for two years, then we risk the deaths of over 240,000 patients. As functional status is an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality. I believe by preserving cognitive function, Simufilam will also preserve functional status (as the two are highly correlated). It may take years to see a mortality benefit, but waiting years in the setting of limited risk is unacceptable. I and my cosigners are humbly and optimistically submitting this Citizens Petition to review m my risk-benefit analysis. I look forward to the FDA's correspondence.

We all know about the chip shortage yada yada yada, and that semiconductors have been raising their prices yada yada yada, those are all good dont get me wrong, but I like the idea more that this could breakout soon and run with them AR/VR stocks.

I would probably give away my wife and get me a new one if that becomes a reality!   There are really nice DDs on this ticker here in WSB, you can always search for the ticker in the search bar and you guys will find a lot of info.

For you guys out there that doesnt know what Himax does, it is a fabless semiconductor company that focuses on providing display imaging processing technologies components, such as AR/VR hardware. We all know about the chip shortage yada yada yada, and that semiconductors have been raising their prices yada yada yada, those are all good dont get me wrong, but I like the idea more that this could breakout soon and run with them AR/VR stocks. Anyway, posted below are their customers:   Wouldnt it be nice if those two things encircled in yellow are the talked about Apple glasses and the all new Occulus Quest from Facebook? I would probably give away my wife and get me a new one if that becomes a reality!   There are really nice DDs on this ticker here in WSB, you can always search for the ticker in the search bar and you guys will find a lot of info.  I got 7,000 shares initially and will add on breakout. This is not financial advise and I am not a financial adviser. I am someone needing money so I can afford to have another wife. Thank you and goodluck to all!"

At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time. From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.  There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day. Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play. Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider.

People failed to realize how transformative the pandemic has been to Cazoo's business.  Now that they have a $1B dollar warchest from the SPAC deal (trust + PIPE), they can aggressively go about crushing the competition taking a leaf out of Amazon's playbook. This cash they got from the deal is a moat that insulates them from competition as they rapidly expand and acquire new customers.

What the shit would Tesla even need to do for profit in order to even justify it's current valuation???? 1.2t market cap. Amazon is at 1.7t and the most profitable car company rn is Toyota at 300b .......???,"Mind you Walmart is at 400b market cap. So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... I've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... If Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . Look I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. The question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? Another note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that. Edit : this is just speculation but hear me out on this Tesla's car margin went up 30% recent quarter ... Now I did some googling turns out Tesla's build quality and assembly is ranked the lowest . So what does this mean? Well it's obvious. This is a very common stock hype strategy. They sacrifice build quality by getting cheap parts and assembly. on paper itll look great for short term profit it's no wonder margin is at 30% then they report it. Boom everyone eats it up HYYYYPPPE. Stock shoots up!! Bruh at this rate Tesla solely survives on hype and elon fucking knows it 😂😂😂😂😂😂 . It's a very obvious stock hype strategy tbh. Do you seriously think this company that is entirely pressured to perform on paper wouldn't go this length? Honestly this is the only thing Elon can do in order to maintain this level of stock price . It's actually a no brainer. Because as soon as that sheet of paper looks bad. Y'all know what's gonna happen. And he knows what's gonna happen. So long as he report good news albeit paper news . All's is well. It's a very common tactic for public company in order to showcase short term paper gains. In order to shoot the stock upwards. Some even layoff workers, it's just speculation.

The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. The question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? Another note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that. Edit : this is just speculation but hear me out on this Tesla's car margin went up 30% recent quarter ... Now I did some googling turns out Tesla's build quality and assembly is ranked the lowest . So what does this mean? Well it's obvious. This is a very common stock hype strategy. They sacrifice build quality by getting cheap parts and assembly. on paper itll look great for short term profit it's no wonder margin is at 30% then they report it. Boom everyone eats it up HYYYYPPPE. Stock shoots up!! Bruh at this rate Tesla solely survives on hype and elon fucking knows it 😂😂😂😂😂😂 . It's a very obvious stock hype strategy tbh. Do you seriously think this company that is entirely pressured to perform on paper wouldn't go this length? Honestly this is the only thing Elon can do in order to maintain this level of stock price . It's actually a no brainer. Because as soon as that sheet of paper looks bad. Y'all know what's gonna happen. And he knows what's gonna happen. So long as he report good news albeit paper news . All's is well. It's a very common tactic for public company in order to showcase short term paper gains. In order to shoot the stock upwards. Some even layoff workers, it's just speculation. But my money is on this."
