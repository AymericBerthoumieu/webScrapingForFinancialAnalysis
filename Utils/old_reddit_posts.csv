It is not over, despite the weak guidance given during last week's earnings call.  The catalysts are part gas guzzler present and part EV/AV future.  Think of this stock as a plug-in hybrid.  It has something Boomers and Zoomers each should love, and both combined will continue pushing up the price.    Look, it's easy to hate GM.  For me it's personal. When I was young and on the cusp of becoming a full Chad, I bought a used  That GM went bankrupt.  Rightfully so.  This time they promise a new GM.  Maybe they'll finally pull it off.  The important thing here is you don't have to like their cars to like the stock. I like this stock. Why? We have a market actively trying to figure out how to value it.  It's already run from $40 to $58 this year before pulling back to $53.60 at Friday's close - and it's only the 3rd week of February.  ""Priced In"" you're going to say.  I'm going to argue it is not.  Quite the opposite. GM is undergoing a full re-rating, which it deserves.  To wit:  GM has killed earnings expectations the last two quarters in a row.  Absolutely crushed them.  Funny thing about the last 6 months...we're in a worldwide pandemic that has wreaked havoc on supply chains and forced plant closures due to employees unable to work.  And yet... GM just had the best two quarters in their post-bankruptcy history:  GM's earnings history; Source CNBC.com Here's the thing.  The market traditionally has given GM, Ford, and (Fiat/Stellantis)Chrysler almost no valuation for their earnings.  Their history is a lot like the airlines used to be.  They would make money during good times, labor contracts would get renewed and labor would take a chunk of the new found profits, then the market would turn and they would be losing money.  Lather. Rinse. Repeat. So about that recession we're in...GM isn't losing money.  It's making money.  It's making more money than it ever has before.  In a global recession.  In fact, their last quarter has them making more money than any quarter in the next four projected quarters....Hey. Wait a minute.  Look back at all those other quarters in the bar chart above.  Notice something they all have in common?  Green arrows.  They've beaten expectations every quarter. Hold that thought, because it's critical to my thesis.  GM's guidance is a bit of under-promising with a new history of OVER-delivering.  I think the company is straight-up sandbagging future guidance.  I'll also discuss why their warning about the chip shortage hurting production is actually probably helpful to them in the near and medium term.  Let's talk about what GM is doing  One of the reasons GM has a historically low PE ratio is that their business model has been to make everything they have the plant/labor capacity for, and then figure out how to sell it afterwards.  GM is known for high incentives to move Beretta/Aztek like inventory and huge fleet sales to rental car companies to disappear the unwanted cars.  We know that rental cars haven't been buying new inventory the last two quarters, and so GM is selling what they're currently making to higher margin retail customers. Guess which company isn't loaded down with 2020 models on dealer lots?  Gee-effing-Em.  This would be significant even in normal times.  GM is relatively lean on inventory, so they are focused on building 2021 vehicles while their competitors are having to add extra incentives on to move last year's goods - even the stuff that is ""in demand"".   GM even  What's in demand?  GM's new redesigned full size (and high margin) SUV's:  The Chevy Tahoe, the GMC Yukon, and the Cadillac Escalade.  Not only did they get a full redesign, but they all got a decent price bump.  You can actually buy a Mercedes GLS cheaper than a Yukon Denali now.  Fun fact:  GM is still not offering incentives on these models.  A dealer in my area that posts realistic prices on the internet was offering $3K off 2021 Yukons 3 months ago.  He's now listing them at sticker.  And though a volume dealer, he seems to only have 1 or 2 on the lot when I take a peek.  Edmunds forums indicate this is a nationwide  Futhermore, when I check him and other Chevy/GMC dealers, they seem to only have the Premier & High Country Tahoe/Suburbans coming in, or the SLT or Denali trims for the Yukons - the most expensive trim levels.  The Cadillac Dealers I check don't even show a lot of Escalade's in pre-inventory, but those seem to be $100K plus units now...with no incentives or discounts offered. The point?  GM is selling what it is making faster than its peers.  It is making the highest margined units.  It's selling them with fewer incentives generally, and with no incentives on the most in-demand models.  That is cash, printing cash, on top of a bed of cash.  GM's money printer go BRRRRRrrrrrrrr. So with that in mind,  While it's likely that some chips are only for specific models/equipment found on higher end units, most are going to be able to be put into components that could go into a variety of their cars.  When rationing the chips, do you think they're going to make equal allotments for producing Chevy Malibu's as they do Chevy Tahoes?  Hell no.  The chip shortage is going to allow them to not produce dogs that they would otherwise have to pay people to buy.  It will be a cover for them to slow production on the crap they otherwise would have to build but would have trouble selling.  They will instead ( Even better is they're not losing sales here, because their competitors are going to be doing the same thing.  No one is able to pull forward demand or use the shortage to claim market share.  Instead, they're going to increase margins on what is sold, and leave future demand in tact.  What happens when supply is constrained? Especially when demand via stimulus and re-opening economy is increasing?  Prices. Go. Up.  And when prices go up, printer goes BRRRRRrrrrrrr.  Before we get to why Zoomer's should care about GM, let's top off the tank for the Boomers.  Even before you consider the future, GM is undervalued today.  Still.   Let's take a look at GM's PE and make some comparisons.   P/E comparison; CNBC.com Oh, I said GM's run wasn't priced in?  Now I'm telling you that a company that often trades at a 6 PE is cheap an an 11 PE? Yes. I. Am. I'm keying in on the forward PE, because that's what moves the market.  In theory (at least in Boomer world) stocks are valued on a discounted value of future earnings.  Note that GM is still cheaper than the Automotive Industry.  Note it's a hell of a lot cheaper than the Consumer Discretionary Sector.  It's trading only 1/3 the forward PE of the S&P 500.  I argue it is even cheaper than that. Remember my claim of sandbagging?  This is how much GM has beaten earnings in every quarter for the last 4 years:  Q1  $.27 Q2   $.20 Q3   $.20 Q4   $.27  Q1  $.19 Q2  $.03 Q3   $.62 Q4   $.21  Q1   $.30 Q2   $.20 Q3   $41 Q4   $.04  Q1  $.32 Q2  $1.27 Q3   $1.45 Q4   $.33 The average quarterly beat over the past 4 years is $.395, or $1.58 per year.   The average beat over the past four quarters is $.87 per quarter, or $3.37 for the year. Note that GM's company guidance for next year is between $4.50 and $5.25/share.  That puts the CNBC current average street estimate for FY 2021 of $5.32 slightly above the top end of the company's guide.  Street estimates for 2022, which will start having more bearing on the stock, are for $7.05/share. There's not a quarter in the last four years where they didn't beat estimates (though there were some revisions for the pandemic, downward, then upward).  And yet, you can consistently expect GM to beat by roughly forty cents per quarter, or $1.58/year.  Either the company is sandbagging or the Analysts have just not caught up to what's really going on here, in that  Which brings us back to that chart.  GM has a positive PEG ratio.  It's not a dying industrial.  Profits are growing.  The rate of growth is growing.  But even if you just want to keep the forward PE of 10x, what is the real stock price today if they beat next year's earnings by just their 4 year average of $1.58?  That would take their 2021 earnings from a projected $5.32/share to $6.90/share.  That gives you a $69 share price at a 10x Forward PE. (Very Nice!) If you want to go crazy and assume they can beat like they did the past for quarters, that would be an additional $3.37 on to the $5.32 projection, for a 10x forward value of $86.90. That's the range where GM should be today, on current metrics, with current trends in place, at its current (too-low) 10x forward PE valuation.  This is totally based on Boomer metrics, that are all based on lagging indicators (before you do the whole ""forward"" thing to the PE). Let's talk about some more items that will help the street unlock this value, and bring the Zoomers on board to turn this stock into a stonk.     GM has been quite cagey about their pricing for the Lyric, noting they want it to be affordable despite wearing a Cadillac crest.  They've also had trouble moving the last generation Bolt, but a redesign was released on Valentine's day    Some might buy cars, but a lot of them will also travel.  Rental car companies have been operating on lean fleets, and they're going to have to buy again to meet demand.  In a perfect world, they'll start to purchase about the time the industry gets their hands around the chip shortage.  Regardless, they're going to need cars.  Between rental companies and the consumers that will feel better about the economy that haven't yet bought cars, there should be significant new-car demand for the foreseeable future.  $1,400 stimulus checks make a good down payment, no?  Add that to the stimulus money still sitting on the sidelines, and those who have had no where to go lately and those who feel better about their own job security going forward will be ready to make car purchases.    Those catalysts should help keep GM on track to continue their history of beating expectations, as well as grow into their FY2022 earnings projections of $7/share.  But that's not even all of the value here.  GM has assets that the market would be valuing deep into 11 figures if they were rolled into a SPAC or IPO, but don't (yet) contribute to earnings.  Such as...  GM has invested heavily in their autonomous vehicle Cruise division, recently bringing Microsoft on as a partner.  T That forward PE exercise we did?  Cruise isn't contributing anything to earnings, so you're getting it for free.   GM beat the hell out of earnings the last 2 quarters, DURING AN EFFING PANDEMIC. GM''s current inventory situation and product mix indicates they're going to do the same Q1, on the back of low incentives and high demand for their highest margin trucks and SUV's. At worst, expect the high end of GM's own guidance, which would project a 20% annual growth rate from 2020, and the street projections are slightly more than 20% again from 2021 to FY 2022. GM should continue to benefit from the economy reopening, and stimulus even before hand, keeping the party rolling. GM is ready to transition to the EV space where Wall Street is valuing pre-revenue companies with stupid valuations, yet GM isn't even fully/fairly valued on the profits they're making today. No valuation is yet given to GM's share in Cruise, which is worth somewhere around 20% of today's market capitalization based on the latest round of financing that brought in Microsoft as a partner.  So how do you value this stock, and is it ready to become a stonk? Let's start with worse case scenario: Assume GM hits the low end of range for 2021 for earnings at $4.50.  Give them a 10x PE and that gets us to $45/share.  Add $10/share for Cruise at 50% ownership and you get a stock valued as if it has no growth prospects at $55/share.  That's where we are, today +/-.  The market has not priced in any upside I've written about, or even the company's top end guide, or the history of beating earnings expectations. GM is a growth stock.  It needs a re-rating. Again, if we're willing to allow for an Oranges to Apples comparison, let's look back at one of the highest profile re-ratings, Apple.   I'm not going to suggest GM should have Apple's PE any more than I'm going to suggest GM should have Tesla's valuation because they're going to become an all EV company.  Apples to Oranges, and all. After years of cyclical earnings boom and bust cycles, GM has charted a future where they can grow earnings consistently. The fact that GM is increasing earnings during a recession and that earnings are projected to continue increasing at 20%/year for the foreseeable future says that it deserves a higher multiple for this growth. Giving a peg ratio of 1 to the 20% earnings growth projection for the next two years would give the company a 20 PE.  That would have GM valued at no less than $90 today, rising to $140 by the end of 2022. The street isn't ready to go there yet, nor am I.  I'd take a middle ground.  10x 2022's earnings plus the value of Cruise gets you an $80 stock.  It won't jump there tomorrow, but it will move a little when the next stimulus passes (presumably before the March unemployment expiration deadline).  It will move up when the EV tax credit begins to move through Congress.  It will move up more when it passes, as it specifically benefits GM.  It will go up when we declare some form of herd immunity when 150 Million of us are vaccinated, and there's another leg of the re-open trade.  And somewhere in there, it will go up when GM beats earnings forecasts again, then again.  I try to time it out in the final summation/play.  Look at the price action after GM (again) beat earnings, but guided down.  The stock moved from an all time high of 57+ and did a 10% retracement back to the $52.50-53 range, which it fought three times and held:  Weekly GM price action before and after earnings; CNBC.com That's a totally natural reaction for folks wanting to lock in their gains after a really strong run, but also  a decline that didn't/couldn't become a rout.  At $52.50, this values GM at 9.5x GM's lowest 2021 guidance plus Cruise, and at only 6x 2022 estimates plus Cruise.  That's just...stupid low.  Barring a major market selloff, this should be GM's floor. This stock is cheap.  There's still time to get on board the rocket.  It's gonna stonk.    Q1 (May reporting):  Trailing PE of 11 = 58.52; Forward PE of 10.2 = 63.64.   Your base case is that GM is a $60 stock by May.  I'm adding bets here and scooping the upside if I'm right.  (I fully expect it to be a $60 stock before March expiration, YMMV). Q2 (August reporting):  Trailing PE of 11 = 77.33; Forward PE of 10.2 = 68.24.   Again, GM should be a $70 stock by mid-summer based only on current street estimates of earnings as if GM is a dying industrial.  This gives no upside to the re-rating that should be ongoing as EV's and Autonomous Vehicles become more of the street's focus with GM.  This also presumes I'm wrong and GM doesn't beat by $.40/quarter as is their average over the past four years, which would yield even higher targets.    GM calls.   I bought March 45's ATM for $2.51 in early January.  Those have done well, and given that I expect 60 before they expire I'm holding. I got a little greedy chasing the stock into earnings and bought the Feb 55 calls just before earnings for $2.70 after watching it run but not having the conviction earlier to pull the trigger.  Dumb move.  I wish I had written all of this down sooner.   Hat tip to ","GM Has More Gas Left In The Tank General Motors' stock has had a good run.  It is not over, despite the weak guidance given during last week's earnings call.  The catalysts are part gas guzzler present and part EV/AV future.  Think of this stock as a plug-in hybrid.

That's where we are, today +/-.  The market has not priced in any upside I've written about, or even the company's top end guide, or the history of beating earnings expectations. GM is a growth stock.  It needs a re-rating. Again, if we're willing to allow for an Oranges to Apples comparison, let's look back at one of the highest profile re-ratings, Apple.   I'm not going to suggest GM should have Apple's PE any more than I'm going to suggest GM should have Tesla's valuation because they're going to become an all EV company.  Apples to Oranges, and all. After years of cyclical earnings boom and bust cycles, GM has charted a future where they can grow earnings consistently. The fact that GM is increasing earnings during a recession and that earnings are projected to continue increasing at 20%/year for the foreseeable future says that it deserves a higher multiple for this growth. Giving a peg ratio of 1 to the 20% earnings growth projection for the next two years would give the company a 20 PE.  That would have GM valued at no less than $90 today, rising to $140 by the end of 2022. The street isn't ready to go there yet, nor am I.  I'd take a middle ground.  10x 2022's earnings plus the value of Cruise gets you an $80 stock.  It won't jump there tomorrow, but it will move a little when the next stimulus passes (presumably before the March unemployment expiration deadline).  It will move up when the EV tax credit begins to move through Congress.  It will move up more when it passes, as it specifically benefits GM.  It will go up when we declare some form of herd immunity when 150 Million of us are vaccinated, and there's another leg of the re-open trade.  And somewhere in there, it will go up when GM beats earnings forecasts again, then again.  I try to time it out in the final summation/play.  Look at the price action after GM (again) beat earnings, but guided down.  The stock moved from an all time high of 57+ and did a 10% retracement back to the $52.50-53 range, which it fought three times and held:  Weekly GM price action before and after earnings; CNBC.com That's a totally natural reaction for folks wanting to lock in their gains after a really strong run, but also  a decline that didn't/couldn't become a rout.  At $52.50, this values GM at 9.5x GM's lowest 2021 guidance plus Cruise, and at only 6x 2022 estimates plus Cruise.  That's just...stupid low.  Barring a major market selloff, this should be GM's floor. This stock is cheap.  There's still time to get on board the rocket.  It's gonna stonk.    Q1 (May reporting):  Trailing PE of 11 = 58.52; Forward PE of 10.2 = 63.64.   Your base case is that GM is a $60 stock by May.  I'm adding bets here and scooping the upside if I'm right.  (I fully expect it to be a $60 stock before March expiration, YMMV). Q2 (August reporting):  Trailing PE of 11 = 77.33; Forward PE of 10.2 = 68.24.   Again, GM should be a $70 stock by mid-summer based only on current street estimates of earnings as if GM is a dying industrial.  This gives no upside to the re-rating that should be ongoing as EV's and Autonomous Vehicles become more of the street's focus with GM.  This also presumes I'm wrong and GM doesn't beat by $.40/quarter as is their average over the past four years, which would yield even higher targets.    GM calls.   I bought March 45's ATM for $2.51 in early January.  Those have done well, and given that I expect 60 before they expire I'm holding. I got a little greedy chasing the stock into earnings and bought the Feb 55 calls just before earnings for $2.70 after watching it run but not having the conviction earlier to pull the trigger.  Dumb move.  I wish I had written all of this down sooner.

Prayers up for the little homie FSLY 😭 PS bought the WKHS dip  The latest retail numbers were outstanding during the report this morning, which as an interesting side affect have caused a giant spike in the treasury yield. For the uninitiated, higher treasury yields bring downward pressure on stocks. Will be watching closely to see if the yield flattens on the open. Hope you grabbed the recommended VXX; as I mentioned the stubborn treasury yield could present some short term issues. FUBO flying premarket FSLY PLEASE FUCKING FLY   When these positions open big, please wait for dips FYI. I believe in the plays, but you need to choose entry points with common sense discretion.     To be seen: EV ————————- Hi.  Here's what I'm looking at headed into next week.  I monitor flow on Barchart and Think or Swim I’ve typically written about choosing close-dated plays, but I’m giving a little expiration room on these as I sense some sector rotation I want to feel out. Been on a nice little streak with these of late, so I am overdue for an account correction lol.  This is not investment advice.   I like this for two reasons.      Everyone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:    I have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and    Another one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.   **EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**🚗 🚀 Major call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.       As I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of ""My 600 LB Life"", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: Random twitter ---> Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----> random analyst upgrades ---> CNBC pump ----> several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn      Quantitave Easing is taking a hit.   I change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics. (Tuesday this time)  Tech calls drying up for the meantime, looks like the outflow could be headed to speculative sectors, particularly EV.  Potential DOW flight coming.  Hedge with VXX pretty heavily, and retail that is doing digital integration may get the proper spotlight now post-meme.   Inbox always open.

TSLA has really turned it around today. ._1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}._30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}._29m-SAo1wzA0dkdfJutrjs{fill:var(--newCommunityTheme-button)}

Prayers up for the little homie FSLY 😭 PS bought the WKHS dip  The latest retail numbers were outstanding during the report this morning, which as an interesting side affect have caused a giant spike in the treasury yield. For the uninitiated, higher treasury yields bring downward pressure on stocks. Will be watching closely to see if the yield flattens on the open. Hope you grabbed the recommended VXX; as I mentioned the stubborn treasury yield could present some short term issues. FUBO flying premarket FSLY PLEASE FUCKING FLY   When these positions open big, please wait for dips FYI. I believe in the plays, but you need to choose entry points with common sense discretion.     To be seen: EV ————————- Hi.  Here's what I'm looking at headed into next week.  I monitor flow on Barchart and Think or Swim I’ve typically written about choosing close-dated plays, but I’m giving a little expiration room on these as I sense some sector rotation I want to feel out. Been on a nice little streak with these of late, so I am overdue for an account correction lol.  This is not investment advice.   I like this for two reasons.      Everyone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:    I have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and    Another one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.   **EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**🚗 🚀 Major call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.       As I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of ""My 600 LB Life"", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: Random twitter ---> Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----> random analyst upgrades ---> CNBC pump ----> several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn      Quantitave Easing is taking a hit.   I change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics. (Tuesday this time)  Tech calls drying up for the meantime, looks like the outflow could be headed to speculative sectors, particularly EV.  Potential DOW flight coming.  Hedge with VXX pretty heavily, and retail that is doing digital integration may get the proper spotlight now post-meme.   Inbox always open.

222,2021-01-29 20:29:00.324922,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,83.0,u/Walk_About7,My plan for maximum slow cooked chicken tendies,"Let's all take a second to look around. What's been happening here? Rockets here, rockets there. This whole fucking sub is filled with people throwing around their red rockets. Some of these rockets go up into the ethereal tendie heavens, but most go plunge straight into the markets gaping, mangy abyss. Why do I mention rockets? Enter ARKX. The rocket itself. The real deal rocket. For all you tards who haven't looked up from blowing bubbles in your cereal for the past 10 years, let me paint you a picture on what has been going on. The future is here. We are in a god damned technological revolution. Most of all, we're in a new space race. ""Wait, you mean we're going back to blasting chimps into space then fingering their assholes when they get back, then telling the Reds to smell my finger?"" No. We're going to space to stay. And you what's going to happen up there? Industry. NASA already estimates that wealth from mining minerals on asteroids is in the QUADRILLIONS. I call bullshit on that figure. The universe is infinite. Therefore there is infinite wealth up there. NASA's gonna go up there, and some cuck with a clipboard will be like, ""Yea, we lowballed that one.""  I know, I know, all you dingleberrys that are stuck in the 80's, are thinking, ""NASA choked on Challenger's dick and died right there on the spot."" That's sure what it looked like. Well guess what. They're back, and they're now riding the coat tails of every fucking smooth-brained, money making messiah that you worship and make gainz off of. Did you look at the article that I linked? Probably not. I'll sum it up for you. Jeff Bezoz has his plans of going up there too, to do a little mining for himself. Look at his fucking head. Notice anything? IT'S SMOOTH AS EGGS. Draw your own conclusion on that one. I don't really even need to touch on Papa Musk's plans. His mission is our mission. It's inherent at this point. You know everything that he touches turns into hard cash for you. Everytime you sit there trying to yank one out of your noodly, skinny pale trouser snake, you always have to, ""pour one out for Elon."" His target is to send 1 million people to Mars by 2050.  Do you think he's going to overpromise and underdeliver on that? Do you know what his kid's name is? This man is looking so far into the future, we don't even have language to express his kid's name. Here's what's going to happen. In no more than 10 years time. More like 5 years. Captain Kirk will be on TV trying to sell you intergalactic travel packages at discounted rates. Of course you go. Your buddy, Chad, is stuck flipping burgers on some distant mining base, talking up all the dividends he's racking up bi-annually off his companies plan. You, on the other hand, have more nefarious plans in mind. Sure it's fun to hit Chad's bong on the dark side of some cold asteroid and talk about the old days, but you have better plans. You've got a date with a cheap alien lady-boy whore, parked on lovers lane overlooking the Eagle Nebula. All the while, you plan on going knuckles deep in any mucous filled orifice you can find. And that's on a THURSDAY. So here's the skinny on ARKX. Listen up. For all the ass hats who don't know who Cathie Wood is, you will now. In 2018, Papa Musk was in a bit of a rut. He was losing faith in TSLA, and contemplating it's future, (I know, hard to believe). In fact, it was so bad, Elon was practically begging to suck Tim Apples ding-a-ling to get bought up.  You know who was there by Papa Musk's side? That's right. Meet your new mommy, Momma Wood. She gave Papa Elon the best fucking prostate orgasm ever, and with that, the clarity that TSLA was going to propel him to Mars and beyond. So every time you're having wet dreams about sucking Elon's monster dong, you're eternally in debt to Mama Wood. But she doesn't fault you for not giving her credit. You know why that is? Because she is a Goddess. She's humble. She knows that at some point, one day, your eyes will be opened, and that you will recognize her for her past efforts, and for her future plans. ARKX. She knows that once you have this realization, you will be bent over, gallon jug of off-branded cooking fat in hand, ready to have her peg your stanky ingrown hair infested asshole. You will be BEGGING her, ""MoAR tHicC GaINz, PLEEZE!"" So what's play here. I love a good YOLO. I wake up every morning expecting to see gainz porn from all these rocket launches we've been having. For me, personally, I'm mildly autistic. You could say half-autistic. My wife and her boyfriend's children are all autistic. I want the YOLO gainz, but I also want to know where to put some of my gainz, as my wife, her boyfriend, and their children are all dependent on me for money. So I got to be smart, you see. As I see it, ARKX is a slow cooker for your tendies. There's nothing like making a cool, quick ten bagger on some FD's. That rush is unmatched. That feeling of having a greasy burger after munching on your boyfriends asshole for an hour straight. ARKX, on the other hand, is like few have thought to experience. Like fine aged wine or whiskey. Slow cooked, tender, melt in your melt tendies. 100x in the next ten years, conservatively, tendies. Set-it-and-forget-it tendies. They practically fall apart in your mouth. This DD doesn't even begin to touch the vastness of what's all in play with space exploration plays. I don't know what's going to be in ARKX, or where it will begin trading at. I also don't know the exact date it will begin trading, I heard the last week of March at the latest. Keep an eye out. I'm sure you will hear when it does commence. For me, I already threw a bunch of stagnant savings I had in ARKF. Let me tell you what, I am not disappointed I did that. When ARKX comes out, my IRA will be converted to ARKX, but I will be keeping my boomer AAPL, and holy TSLA shares. I will be set. I have utmost confidence this will be the easiest, long term print around. Thank you for your time. I'm a half retard, not an investment advisor.

Stock market intraday patterns – all times are in Eastern Standard Time! When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them. 9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile! 9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself. 10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback. 11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‘drift’ for the next hour or more. 11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it. 1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in. 2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price. --- 3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big “Shake-out” points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves. As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile. 3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It’s common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or “cross”. Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade  Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price. 6. Expiration – Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta – a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date – your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low. 7. Position size – This is important – BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It’s much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%. 8. Future moves – Think beyond what’s going on with a stock than just in the current day – unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don’t rush your entry – You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I’d take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.","Support group for FOMO weed gang Please share with me how you wish you didn’t fall for it today and how you kept averaging down yet it is still going down, after you do that read this Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology Check out my profile for stock Analysis by request.

For everyone who doesn’t want to read a wall of text there’s a   Canoo has completed its SPAC merger and ticker change a little over a month ago going from HCAC to GOEV. Ever since the combination it has been piled into by shorts. The short position has grown exponentially from 99k shares to over 10 million as of the last update by NASDAQ. I subscribe to S3 Capital’s retail short algorithm which gives a more accurate current estimate of ~11 million shares short. New available shorts are nearly nonexistent and borrow rates are sky rocketing. If you haven’t been living under a rock the past couple of weeks you already know how well short squeezes can play out.     GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.  Canoo’s leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 & i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that’s not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car… the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn’t take a genius to connect these dots.   I am holding shares as well as options. I recommend shares as it is the safer bet. We all know how long hedge-funds can hold a stock down for and burn your theta.

GOEV has a ton of positive catalyst the shorts are overlooking and I believe this will lead to large losses on their side. For one, the EV revolution is here to stay as you can tell from the new administration. Biden plans to electrify the whole federal fleet (estimated 650k vehicles). GOEV  has the perfect mid sized commercial B2B purpose built vehicle which fits the build of many government vehicles. The Canoo purpose built vehicle can replace for example USPS mail trucks.  Canoo’s leadership are veterans in the automotive industry which is hard to say for some of the other SPAC *cough * NKLA. Canoo's co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was CTO at EV carmaker Faraday Future and more importantly has over 30 years of management experience at BMW. He worked to reimagine the MINI brand, develop the company's first SUV, and the iProject (BMW i8 & i3). They also poached talent from Tesla; Sohel Merchant (vehicle architecture) Christoph Kuttner (vehicle trim), and Alexi Charbonneau (proprietary EV skateboard tech) just to name a few. The real value here is their proprietary B2B skateboard platform for EVs. Allowing for any automaker to design and build their perfect sedan and just clip on to an already existing powertrain. Now AAPL is most likely going to sign an EV production contract with Hyundai/KIA (expected as soon as Feb 17th) confirmed last night by the  3.6 Billion investment. GOEV is already providing their platform to Hyundai/KIA. GOEV has already been validated by AAPL as in AAPL wanted to buy them out in 2020 so clearly they like their tech. And if you think that’s not enough to sell you on this theory then listen to this: In 2015, Apple almost used the BMW i3 as the basis for its Apple Car… the two founders of Canoo were the top guys on the iProject. It doesn’t take a genius to connect these dots.   I am holding shares as well as options. I recommend shares as it is the safer bet. We all know how long hedge-funds can hold a stock down for and burn your theta.

While I’m not claiming they are or aren’t happening, I think it is important to understand how institutional trading works. For reference, I work on the sell side so im a semi-suit (im not an execution trader, but I have enough friends who are). You may notice that these stocks trade in 100 share increments, this is by design and has a name, they’re called “round lots” and are used to break up large orders. These round lots are used by every single institution in order to not smash through the bid/ask walls and ensure orderly markets. They are not evidence of a short ladder attack. Think about it, if a fund wanted to buy $1,000,000,000 worth of AAPL, they could never place a market order as they would move the market against them, and a limit order would never fill. They could use a dark pool to buy without advertising their order, or find a willing partner for a block trade. They also, very frequently have to use low touch VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) algos (much different than prop algos) to buy in the open markets on an exchange. These algorithms ingest the order, and then execute the trade based on a predefined % of volume, ie. the sell side execution trader never wants his/her orders to take up more than xx% of volume. As the algo operates throughout the day, it executes thousands of round lot trades. These round lot trades are the 100 share increments you see each day. All the 100 share increments mean is that you are seeing institutional volume mixed in with odd lot trades (blocks not in increments of 100 shares).   Most importantly...  Edits with interesting questions:  A: They're not choosing 100 shares, their order is much larger, probably thousands or tens of thousands of shares. The algo breaks up that order into 100 share round lots and executes the trade. The reason for this is simple, its easy to match  100 share lots than it is to try to piece together orders. If the seller is asking $xx.xx for 100 shares, the buyer can bid $xx.xx for 100 shares and the match is made. If you have 13 shares at one price, 29 shares at another price, and 91 shares at another price on both the bid and ask side, complexity increases materially.  A: Because order flow from retail brokerages too thin to combine market orders into a single round lot once it makes its way over to a MM, so they just execute an odd lot order. It is what they have to do and is the last part of my answer above.","Clarification on ""short ladder"" attacks and Round Lots vs Odd Lots So I have seen a lot of posts pointing to GME (and others) volume as an indication of short ladder attacks.
