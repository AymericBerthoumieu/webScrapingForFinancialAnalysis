At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time. From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.  There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day. Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play. Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider.

As usual the chip shortage still looms over tech companies such as Apple and with the new iPhone 13 release I‚Äôm questioning if it was as much of a success and as profitable as the company predicted. I‚Äôm not too worried necessarily about the earnings per share, I‚Äôm more worried about the outlook of the company for the rest of the year and going into 2022. The majority of Apples iPhone sales occur during the holiday season and I‚Äôm not sure if supply will be able to meet the high demand. Personally I feel like there is always the highest jump in iPhone demand every 3 generations due to the general trend of how the average consumer upgrades. Such as with the iPhone 6 to the iPhone X, then to the 13. Apple is amazing and like with many other companies, they have made many advancements and innovations but just haven‚Äôt had the chance to benefit from them to the fullest extent financially due to the economic and supply restraints brought along by Covid. The market at the moment is propped up by hope for the future, which I think is fine, it shows that more investors are bullish and in it for the long haul.

Well, it‚Äôs now the largest company in the world. The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant. Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to  And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult! Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE. Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical. I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC. AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.üòÇ INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction. But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals. It‚Äôs supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think). Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely. Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything? If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. (I am not saying you shouldn‚Äôt buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult) As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely. With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter. TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults. Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.","The power of cult: Why I think DWAC is primed to move higher and so will other similar cult stocks Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?

2021-10-18 13:11:32.050434,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,150.0,u/Stonkgang_,How To Pick BIG MOVERS üöÄ - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.," The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average ‚ÄúAverage daily range‚Äù for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it‚Äôs shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it‚Äôs our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let‚Äôs assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip). In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive. Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).   Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it‚Äôs potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position. However it‚Äôs not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let‚Äôs take a look at two names with similar ADRs.    2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.   As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you‚Äôre a day trader with a short bias.  One of the large misconceptions with beginner traders are that penny stocks provide a better chance of large percentage/monetary gains. More often that not this couldn‚Äôt be any further from the truth. For this example we‚Äôre going to compare two speculative names to keep things fair. Both names have almost no revenue and are therefore considered as speculative plays.    Since early February 2021 this stock has been in a downtrend with any moves higher being aggressively sold into. The volume has decreased on a weekly and daily basis which tells us there‚Äôs very little attention on the name and therefore it‚Äôs very unlikely we‚Äôll see any worthwhile movement soon. There is also currently no hype in or surrounding the sector. It‚Äôs current stock price is $5.60 and has an ADR of 4.47% 2. Lithium America. Another speculation name which has received quite a lot of attention across social media and amateur traders, however there‚Äôs a huge difference. Firstly the chart isn‚Äôt trending lower but the complete opposite as it attempts to break into all time highs. Secondly the volume is increasing which shows attention to the name is increasing and therefore a big move is likely (one has recently happened, we traded it). Thirdly there is a large amount of hype in the sector with similar names also being bought and gaining attention. The current price of this stock is $25.43 and the ADR on this stock is 6.73%   So in this example we have two speculative stocks both with little to no revenue. However the Penny stock NNDM has a downtrending chart, no hype, no volume and therefore almost no chance of breaking out.Lithium America on the other hand has a very strong chart, lots of volume, increase hype and therefore a great chance of breaking out. It‚Äôs irrelevant if you have $500 to invest or $500,000 as Lithium America in this example on any given day will provide a larger move and better return than NNDM. Not to mention that the likelihood of the move happening on Lithium America is far greater due to the points outlined.  The ADR can also be used to avoid bad entries using the simple mathematics and change of probability. If you‚Äôre looking to get into a name which has had no news, no increase in volume and isn‚Äôt set to breakout then you‚Äôll want to avoid entering if it‚Äôs already close to 1 ADR. Based on averages and the law of probability it‚Äôs extremely likely that in that scenario you‚Äôll be entering at the high of the day. The opposite to this is a strong name that‚Äôs holding its trend is reaching 1 ADR to the downside. If all other factors look good then the law of probability states you‚Äôre likely buying at the low of the day. On aggressive breakouts and large catalysts such as earnings we can use the ADR to determine where we take profits or when we may avoid a late entry. It's not uncommon for large catalysts like a big earnings beat to provide 3-5 ADR's on the first day. You can therefore once again use the data to determine the probability of continuation and a good/bad entry.  We use ADR to filter out the names which have the potential to provide us with a significant move. However they must also have a clean technical chart with some form of growth and/or growth potential. The ADR is the key number to go by Ideally you want to see a minimum of 3% ADR and ideally something within the 5-10% range.","How To Pick BIG MOVERS üöÄ - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.  The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average ‚ÄúAverage daily range‚Äù for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it‚Äôs shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it‚Äôs our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let‚Äôs assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip). In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive. Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).   Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it‚Äôs potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position. However it‚Äôs not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let‚Äôs take a look at two names with similar ADRs.    2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.   As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you‚Äôre a day trader with a short bias.

2021-10-13 13:11:33.709445,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,20.0,u/MaybeRocketScience,Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging,"Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off. Would like to share my findings and have opinions on how to play this. The hedge fund in question is  I cannot mention the company, as: - based on quick calculations, they never reached the $1.5B market cap threshold, and are hence (appropriately) qualified per WSB rules as ""worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes"". - otherwise every single person on WSB would load up on puts or do whatever shit. Anyway, if you have minimal research skills you'll guess/find what I'm talking about. I'll call it Company X for this post. Company X has no meaningful revenue, and does nothing but lose money. In the management team, there's a guy who recently settled for fraud, for his involvement in another company (which recently collapsed). The stock used to have a total market cap of ~$20M, right now, after massive dilution (5x O/S in a few months), shares are trading higher and the total market cap is ~$650M. Company X has recently engaged in a flurry of M&A, spinoffs and whatever else, creating potential ""catalysts"". It's also heavily promoted by well known Twitter personalities. Not having the cash to fund such endeavors, they started issuing convertible notes. And here Hudson Bay comes into play. The hedge fund offered hundreds of millions $ to Company X in convertible notes with short expiration (note: company revenue ~$2.5M). Other warrants have been offered to them and, to a lesser extent, to other firms. As Company X doesn't make money, but spends a decent bit, they are now asking shareholders to approve early exercise of all warrants.  Very few warrants issued Pointing out that, without that, the company would be in a tough situation (and realistically the M&A activities might be gone):  A little nudge on the vote Hudson Bay Capital would have, including the convertible note, warrants for about 120M shares, which is more than the current O/S total (~100M). Dumping such truckload of shares wouldn't be feasible, with current volumes. Hence, I suspect they are pulling of a magic financial trick called Warrant hedging I know, what the hell is this, who the fuck trades warrants, etc. Warrants are basically call options, but they're issued by the company, hence the money would go straight to them if exercised. Warrant hedging means: - you hold a warrant at $10 - you place a short at $20 - your position is hedged. No matter where the price goes, you locked in a risk free profit. It's also an unsqueezable short, since you can't get margin called. The moment such warrants are exercised, you cash out of your position with $10 in profit, the company cashes in $10 from the warrant, and shareholders are left holding the bag. There are a series of things that make me suspect such strategy is being employed. The first is that the SI has gone nowhere but up lately, despite the supposed ""squeeze"" and the subsequent tanking. It's worth noting that high SI has been recently attracting flocks of retail traders, hoping for squeeze profits. Price action would look manipulated: whenever the share price approaches the warrant level, volume dries up until there's a rebound, often ""catalyst"" triggered. Then huge volume, price goes flat/down, rinse and repeat. HBC can place a de-facto risk free short anytime the price is above the warrants (lowest is $2.655). This leads to a situation in which they could, in principle, short a ton of Company X stock, wake up on the day after the early exercise is approved, and cover their position by exercising their warrants. No messed up price action, which they'd get if they were to dump their position, just a sudden spike in O/S. There are a few instances in which this may not be the case: - HBC actually plans to dump their position after early exercise is allowed. Whatever. - HBC plans to hold >$700M, close to 10% of their portfolio, in a single low cap stock with no revenue and dubious management. This would dwarf their  - shareholders vote against the proposal. This opens up a pandora box of deals falling apart, and potential default, for Company X. Considering that, in principle, the last could happen and create some turbulence, and looking at a SI of ~20-25%, I would think HBC is employing this strategy for a decent chunk, but not all, of their holdings. Last thing to note: the company has placed another ""catalyst"" (spinoff) one week after the vote, possibly to encourage retail not to offload their shares. This was originally planned for the day after the vote, but has since been postponed. It would help the hedge fund dump the rest of the shares. The question now is:  I bought some puts, was swimming in the green, getting hammered this week. Would you think puts for the spinoff week would work? Puts for this Friday? A month from now? And especially, could the warrant hedging just balloon the O/S without any meaningful price action when exercised? In which case, my puts would be fucked? That's all, thanks for coming to my TED talk tl;dr : the Hudson Bay Capital hedge fund is pulling off some serious fuckery","Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off.

Evergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real. Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood. Why isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market.

But what I found extremely interesting is the timeline of the news.  -about an hour later FB and it's other platforms experience an outage -around the same time or within the hour news breaks of the FTC complaints and news relating to the gov't trying to force the sale of insta and WhatsApp. So here's my theory. Also to me this sounds all tin foily but also slightly plausible. So I am reaching out to the apes here that are much smarter than me to help fact check or provide any insight. Or just straight up rip this statement apart if it is a crock of shit. Let's begin. So what I'm thinking is would it be far fetched to assume that these the outage is by no means a coincidence but rather planned? With the news of the whistle blower breaking out what if FB intentionally took their servers offline to either: A. Discretely purge records that would confirm whistle blowers statements B. Strong arm the gov't to drop the suit by blaming them on a future date for the outage and having public backlash force the gov't to back off. Why I think this might be plausible is for anyone that's familiar with the game Eve online it's a game that everyones plays on the same server at the same time all over the world regardless of timezone. Therefore the server is always on except for a scheduled downtime that takes the server offline to allow for patches and updates. Now FB is similar in the sence that it's an always on service and probably operates on the same server or set of servers (my guess I don't know). What if in order to get rid of any back end digital paper trails you would need to edit at the architecture/frameworks/coding etc (developers/dev ops chime in here I'm not one so this is purely speculative). Now in order to do so would that require the servers be offline? Alternatively point b. That one is a little more self explanatory people as we know are addicted to social media so it wouldn't be a far stretch to assume that if FB pointed the finger at gov't or another scapegoat and said they forced us to do it people would get into a fit and the outrage would be fierce since there's already alot of distrust of the gov't. Since we know FB loves their data and consciousness experiments (i.e Russian interference in 2016 election, and no this isn't a political debate so keep your idiologies out of it) but since they have a general sense of what the consciousness of a country or demographic would be thinking it wouldn't be hard for them to spin stories that subscribe to people's narratives. Because as we can all agree people are almost most accepting of stories that best fit their own internal narratives. So again this might be a wild conspiracy theory. I might just be regarded and over analysing so please if anyone smarter then me can fact check this that would be appreciated","whistle blower may have lead to FB outage? theory So I'm sure you've all seen the news relating to FB today so I'll keep this brief.

2021-10-05 13:12:49.834581,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,19.0,u/bestzec,Leave no Buffett behind. A case for $TEVA Pharmaceuticals coming back with a vengeance,"Was banned from the sub for a few days so posting it a bit late here...  Let‚Äôs start with the elephant in the room. Generics‚Ä¶ Wait no, the company debt Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits Okay there is a room full of elephants and we‚Äôre over the weight limit so let‚Äôs let them out one at a time.  As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D‚Äôs and Wendy‚Äôs all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company‚Äôs market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I‚Äôm mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs right it‚Äôs TEVA. Viagra is clearly not the only drug I‚Äôm on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I‚Äôm popping them like tic tacs. And it‚Äôs the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crpyto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall. Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I‚Äôll be taking that later when I‚Äôm ready to go to sleep. Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need. Oh and if you‚Äôre not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn‚Äôt weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it‚Äôs a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I‚Äôm talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I‚Äôm paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don‚Äôt want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital. Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that‚Äôs just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA‚Äôs revenues comes from generics.  Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you‚Äôre not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA‚Äôs revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they‚Äôll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today‚Äôs prices (This is also a reason why TEVA‚Äôs stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.  There‚Äôs been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let‚Äôs do some ratios. If a giant company like J&J, that‚Äôs worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around ~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion. Are there any elephants left? I‚Äôm sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.  What‚Äôs valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices. You think i‚Äôm going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos‚Äôs ex-wife‚Äôs bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market). Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it‚Äôs more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you‚Äôre in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I‚Äôm coming back for you. What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I‚Äôve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.  Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark. There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They‚Äôve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating. Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That‚Äôs right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they‚Äôve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they‚Äôll keep holding for the price recovery. (Not investing advice)","Leave no Buffett behind.

If they‚Äôve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they‚Äôll keep holding for the price recovery. (Not investing advice)"
2021-10-05 13:12:51.689855,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,110.0,u/ModernBuddha1,Why BB Blackberry patent sale is taking this long,"BB WAS a phone hardware company but now it's a pure cybersecurity and iot software company! They also have about 42,000 patents (2k added in 2020), about 20,000 of that is in the messaging, wireless networking and old business. They won a patent lawsuit against FB in 2020 which i think is worth north of $1 billion alone so bunch of companies (US based likely) are trying to buy off the 20,000 patents from BB. There're 2,000 companies that are infringing on blackberry patents ( US buyers approached BB in 2020 Christmas to buy the 20,000 patents and agreed to a price in christmas 2020, likely in billions. So why is it taking so long? The reason why it's taking so long is because the folks that are short and sold you the call options are afraid of what the announcement will do to the stock price. Now that apes are behind the wheel anything over $1billion is going to sky rocket the stock. the buying parties have shared the patent sale info to banks and MM so now they're trying to drag their feet much as possible. they are afraid this will sky rocket and could easily hit $100 with help of WSB apes. Chen has drawn a line to conclude the sale by end of November latest. If not, he has buyers waiting in line who can go after those 2,000 companies infringing on those patents. This is going to be very interesting. good luck to apes and everyone here for helping blackberry(underdog). These shorts and banks and MM must pay!! This is my opinion based on lot of thinking and information i have on blackberry and its shorts and MM.","Why BB Blackberry patent sale is taking this long BB WAS a phone hardware company but now it's a pure cybersecurity and iot software company!
