At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time. From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.  There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day. Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play. Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider.

As usual the chip shortage still looms over tech companies such as Apple and with the new iPhone 13 release I‚Äôm questioning if it was as much of a success and as profitable as the company predicted. I‚Äôm not too worried necessarily about the earnings per share, I‚Äôm more worried about the outlook of the company for the rest of the year and going into 2022. The majority of Apples iPhone sales occur during the holiday season and I‚Äôm not sure if supply will be able to meet the high demand. Personally I feel like there is always the highest jump in iPhone demand every 3 generations due to the general trend of how the average consumer upgrades. Such as with the iPhone 6 to the iPhone X, then to the 13. Apple is amazing and like with many other companies, they have made many advancements and innovations but just haven‚Äôt had the chance to benefit from them to the fullest extent financially due to the economic and supply restraints brought along by Covid.

Well, it‚Äôs now the largest company in the world. The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant. Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to  And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult! Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE. Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical. I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC. AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.üòÇ INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction. But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals. It‚Äôs supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think). Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely. Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything? If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. (I am not saying you shouldn‚Äôt buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult) As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely. With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter. TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults. Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.","The power of cult: Why I think DWAC is primed to move higher and so will other similar cult stocks Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?

2021-10-18 13:24:14.469589,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,150.0,u/Stonkgang_,How To Pick BIG MOVERS üöÄ - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.," The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average ‚ÄúAverage daily range‚Äù for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it‚Äôs shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it‚Äôs our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let‚Äôs assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip). In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive. Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).   Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it‚Äôs potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position. However it‚Äôs not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let‚Äôs take a look at two names with similar ADRs.    2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.   As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you‚Äôre a day trader with a short bias.  One of the large misconceptions with beginner traders are that penny stocks provide a better chance of large percentage/monetary gains. More often that not this couldn‚Äôt be any further from the truth. For this example we‚Äôre going to compare two speculative names to keep things fair. Both names have almost no revenue and are therefore considered as speculative plays.    Since early February 2021 this stock has been in a downtrend with any moves higher being aggressively sold into. The volume has decreased on a weekly and daily basis which tells us there‚Äôs very little attention on the name and therefore it‚Äôs very unlikely we‚Äôll see any worthwhile movement soon. There is also currently no hype in or surrounding the sector. It‚Äôs current stock price is $5.60 and has an ADR of 4.47% 2. Lithium America. Another speculation name which has received quite a lot of attention across social media and amateur traders, however there‚Äôs a huge difference. Firstly the chart isn‚Äôt trending lower but the complete opposite as it attempts to break into all time highs. Secondly the volume is increasing which shows attention to the name is increasing and therefore a big move is likely (one has recently happened, we traded it). Thirdly there is a large amount of hype in the sector with similar names also being bought and gaining attention. The current price of this stock is $25.43 and the ADR on this stock is 6.73%   So in this example we have two speculative stocks both with little to no revenue. However the Penny stock NNDM has a downtrending chart, no hype, no volume and therefore almost no chance of breaking out.Lithium America on the other hand has a very strong chart, lots of volume, increase hype and therefore a great chance of breaking out. It‚Äôs irrelevant if you have $500 to invest or $500,000 as Lithium America in this example on any given day will provide a larger move and better return than NNDM. Not to mention that the likelihood of the move happening on Lithium America is far greater due to the points outlined.  The ADR can also be used to avoid bad entries using the simple mathematics and change of probability. If you‚Äôre looking to get into a name which has had no news, no increase in volume and isn‚Äôt set to breakout then you‚Äôll want to avoid entering if it‚Äôs already close to 1 ADR. Based on averages and the law of probability it‚Äôs extremely likely that in that scenario you‚Äôll be entering at the high of the day. The opposite to this is a strong name that‚Äôs holding its trend is reaching 1 ADR to the downside. If all other factors look good then the law of probability states you‚Äôre likely buying at the low of the day. On aggressive breakouts and large catalysts such as earnings we can use the ADR to determine where we take profits or when we may avoid a late entry. It's not uncommon for large catalysts like a big earnings beat to provide 3-5 ADR's on the first day. You can therefore once again use the data to determine the probability of continuation and a good/bad entry.  We use ADR to filter out the names which have the potential to provide us with a significant move. However they must also have a clean technical chart with some form of growth and/or growth potential. The ADR is the key number to go by Ideally you want to see a minimum of 3% ADR and ideally something within the 5-10% range.","How To Pick BIG MOVERS üöÄ - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.  The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average ‚ÄúAverage daily range‚Äù for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it‚Äôs shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it‚Äôs our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let‚Äôs assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip). In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive. Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).   Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it‚Äôs potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position. However it‚Äôs not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let‚Äôs take a look at two names with similar ADRs.    2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.   As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you‚Äôre a day trader with a short bias.

2021-10-13 13:24:15.622688,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,20.0,u/MaybeRocketScience,Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging,"Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off. Would like to share my findings and have opinions on how to play this. The hedge fund in question is  I cannot mention the company, as: - based on quick calculations, they never reached the $1.5B market cap threshold, and are hence (appropriately) qualified per WSB rules as ""worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes"". - otherwise every single person on WSB would load up on puts or do whatever shit. Anyway, if you have minimal research skills you'll guess/find what I'm talking about. I'll call it Company X for this post. Company X has no meaningful revenue, and does nothing but lose money. In the management team, there's a guy who recently settled for fraud, for his involvement in another company (which recently collapsed). The stock used to have a total market cap of ~$20M, right now, after massive dilution (5x O/S in a few months), shares are trading higher and the total market cap is ~$650M. Company X has recently engaged in a flurry of M&A, spinoffs and whatever else, creating potential ""catalysts"". It's also heavily promoted by well known Twitter personalities. Not having the cash to fund such endeavors, they started issuing convertible notes. And here Hudson Bay comes into play. The hedge fund offered hundreds of millions $ to Company X in convertible notes with short expiration (note: company revenue ~$2.5M). Other warrants have been offered to them and, to a lesser extent, to other firms. As Company X doesn't make money, but spends a decent bit, they are now asking shareholders to approve early exercise of all warrants.  Very few warrants issued Pointing out that, without that, the company would be in a tough situation (and realistically the M&A activities might be gone):  A little nudge on the vote Hudson Bay Capital would have, including the convertible note, warrants for about 120M shares, which is more than the current O/S total (~100M). Dumping such truckload of shares wouldn't be feasible, with current volumes. Hence, I suspect they are pulling of a magic financial trick called Warrant hedging I know, what the hell is this, who the fuck trades warrants, etc. Warrants are basically call options, but they're issued by the company, hence the money would go straight to them if exercised. Warrant hedging means: - you hold a warrant at $10 - you place a short at $20 - your position is hedged. No matter where the price goes, you locked in a risk free profit. It's also an unsqueezable short, since you can't get margin called. The moment such warrants are exercised, you cash out of your position with $10 in profit, the company cashes in $10 from the warrant, and shareholders are left holding the bag. There are a series of things that make me suspect such strategy is being employed. The first is that the SI has gone nowhere but up lately, despite the supposed ""squeeze"" and the subsequent tanking. It's worth noting that high SI has been recently attracting flocks of retail traders, hoping for squeeze profits. Price action would look manipulated: whenever the share price approaches the warrant level, volume dries up until there's a rebound, often ""catalyst"" triggered. Then huge volume, price goes flat/down, rinse and repeat. HBC can place a de-facto risk free short anytime the price is above the warrants (lowest is $2.655). This leads to a situation in which they could, in principle, short a ton of Company X stock, wake up on the day after the early exercise is approved, and cover their position by exercising their warrants. No messed up price action, which they'd get if they were to dump their position, just a sudden spike in O/S. There are a few instances in which this may not be the case: - HBC actually plans to dump their position after early exercise is allowed. Whatever. - HBC plans to hold >$700M, close to 10% of their portfolio, in a single low cap stock with no revenue and dubious management. This would dwarf their  - shareholders vote against the proposal. This opens up a pandora box of deals falling apart, and potential default, for Company X. Considering that, in principle, the last could happen and create some turbulence, and looking at a SI of ~20-25%, I would think HBC is employing this strategy for a decent chunk, but not all, of their holdings. Last thing to note: the company has placed another ""catalyst"" (spinoff) one week after the vote, possibly to encourage retail not to offload their shares. This was originally planned for the day after the vote, but has since been postponed. It would help the hedge fund dump the rest of the shares. The question now is:  I bought some puts, was swimming in the green, getting hammered this week. Would you think puts for the spinoff week would work? Puts for this Friday? A month from now? And especially, could the warrant hedging just balloon the O/S without any meaningful price action when exercised? In which case, my puts would be fucked? That's all, thanks for coming to my TED talk tl;dr : the Hudson Bay Capital hedge fund is pulling off some serious fuckery","Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off.

In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real. Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again.

Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market.

But what I found extremely interesting is the timeline of the news.  -about an hour later FB and it's other platforms experience an outage -around the same time or within the hour news breaks of the FTC complaints and news relating to the gov't trying to force the sale of insta and WhatsApp. So here's my theory. Also to me this sounds all tin foily but also slightly plausible. So I am reaching out to the apes here that are much smarter than me to help fact check or provide any insight. Or just straight up rip this statement apart if it is a crock of shit. Let's begin. So what I'm thinking is would it be far fetched to assume that these the outage is by no means a coincidence but rather planned? With the news of the whistle blower breaking out what if FB intentionally took their servers offline to either: A. Discretely purge records that would confirm whistle blowers statements B. Strong arm the gov't to drop the suit by blaming them on a future date for the outage and having public backlash force the gov't to back off. Why I think this might be plausible is for anyone that's familiar with the game Eve online it's a game that everyones plays on the same server at the same time all over the world regardless of timezone. Therefore the server is always on except for a scheduled downtime that takes the server offline to allow for patches and updates. Now FB is similar in the sence that it's an always on service and probably operates on the same server or set of servers (my guess I don't know). What if in order to get rid of any back end digital paper trails you would need to edit at the architecture/frameworks/coding etc (developers/dev ops chime in here I'm not one so this is purely speculative). Now in order to do so would that require the servers be offline? Alternatively point b. That one is a little more self explanatory people as we know are addicted to social media so it wouldn't be a far stretch to assume that if FB pointed the finger at gov't or another scapegoat and said they forced us to do it people would get into a fit and the outrage would be fierce since there's already alot of distrust of the gov't. Since we know FB loves their data and consciousness experiments (i.e Russian interference in 2016 election, and no this isn't a political debate so keep your idiologies out of it) but since they have a general sense of what the consciousness of a country or demographic would be thinking it wouldn't be hard for them to spin stories that subscribe to people's narratives. Because as we can all agree people are almost most accepting of stories that best fit their own internal narratives. So again this might be a wild conspiracy theory. I might just be regarded and over analysing so please if anyone smarter then me can fact check this that would be appreciated","whistle blower may have lead to FB outage? theory So I'm sure you've all seen the news relating to FB today so I'll keep this brief.

2021-10-05 13:25:31.098459,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,18.0,u/bestzec,Leave no Buffett behind. A case for $TEVA Pharmaceuticals coming back with a vengeance,"Was banned from the sub for a few days so posting it a bit late here...  Let‚Äôs start with the elephant in the room. Generics‚Ä¶ Wait no, the company debt Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits Okay there is a room full of elephants and we‚Äôre over the weight limit so let‚Äôs let them out one at a time.  As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D‚Äôs and Wendy‚Äôs all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company‚Äôs market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I‚Äôm mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs right it‚Äôs TEVA. Viagra is clearly not the only drug I‚Äôm on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I‚Äôm popping them like tic tacs. And it‚Äôs the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crpyto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall. Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I‚Äôll be taking that later when I‚Äôm ready to go to sleep. Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need. Oh and if you‚Äôre not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn‚Äôt weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it‚Äôs a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I‚Äôm talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I‚Äôm paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don‚Äôt want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital. Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that‚Äôs just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA‚Äôs revenues comes from generics.  Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you‚Äôre not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA‚Äôs revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they‚Äôll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today‚Äôs prices (This is also a reason why TEVA‚Äôs stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.  There‚Äôs been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let‚Äôs do some ratios. If a giant company like J&J, that‚Äôs worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around ~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion. Are there any elephants left? I‚Äôm sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.  What‚Äôs valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices. You think i‚Äôm going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos‚Äôs ex-wife‚Äôs bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market). Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it‚Äôs more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you‚Äôre in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I‚Äôm coming back for you. What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I‚Äôve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.  Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark. There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They‚Äôve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating. Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That‚Äôs right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they‚Äôve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they‚Äôll keep holding for the price recovery. (Not investing advice)","Leave no Buffett behind.

If they‚Äôve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they‚Äôll keep holding for the price recovery. (Not investing advice)"

They also have about 42,000 patents (2k added in 2020), about 20,000 of that is in the messaging, wireless networking and old business. They won a patent lawsuit against FB in 2020 which i think is worth north of $1 billion alone so bunch of companies (US based likely) are trying to buy off the 20,000 patents from BB. There're 2,000 companies that are infringing on blackberry patents ( US buyers approached BB in 2020 Christmas to buy the 20,000 patents and agreed to a price in christmas 2020, likely in billions. So why is it taking so long? The reason why it's taking so long is because the folks that are short and sold you the call options are afraid of what the announcement will do to the stock price. Now that apes are behind the wheel anything over $1billion is going to sky rocket the stock. the buying parties have shared the patent sale info to banks and MM so now they're trying to drag their feet much as possible. they are afraid this will sky rocket and could easily hit $100 with help of WSB apes. Chen has drawn a line to conclude the sale by end of November latest. If not, he has buyers waiting in line who can go after those 2,000 companies infringing on those patents. This is going to be very interesting. good luck to apes and everyone here for helping blackberry(underdog). These shorts and banks and MM must pay!!

What's it like to look into the mirror, unable to see one's own face for seven years? What else are they unable to see? I practice at one of the largest community hospitals in the southeast. As you know, for every 1000 medicare patient days in the hospital, 538 are associated with AD. AD is predictive of an extended and complex hospital stay with increased odds of death (compared to patients who do not have AD).  I have witnessed numerous families bring their elderly father or mother to the ER, saying, ""we cannot take care of him/her."" Not because they are forgetful, but because they are easily agitated and turn aggressive. These families do not ask, ""is there a treatment?"". They have already navigated a complex medical system and know AD is terminal with no effective treatment. Heart attacks, strokes, sepsis, and other diseases seen in hospitals have a myriad of treatments. AD does not. AD is the sixth leading cause, and by some estimates, it is the third leading cause of death. See "" As a patient advocate, I elected to present anecdotal data to contextualize and humanize the numerous awful statistics we all know too well. I review these weighty problems with the FDA to help frame my logic and construct a petition for why Simufilam must be expediently granted accelerated approval and advanced to phase 4 post-marketing surveillance. After reviewing the FDA's mission statement, I am operating on the premise that the FDA evaluates medications based on    Simufilam has been administered to patients across 5 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03748706, NCT04079803, NCT04932655, NCT04388254, NCT04388254). More precisely, 39,620 doses of Simufilam were administered from the publicly available data, with no reported serious  In addition, there are 150 patients enrolled in the ""open-label extension trial"" (OLE). They do not have publicly available information; however, it is reasonable to assume the FDA is privy to safety data. The standard protocol requires study sites to report serious adverse events immediately to the FDA. Those OLE patients were administered another 109,500 doses. Factoring in the OLE patients, in totality,   Data associated with Simufilam has been remarkably consistent. A 28 day multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 64 patients measured:  Cassava Sciences stated:  Open-label Extension data tested:  Tallied up, we have 34 different measures over twelve months and twenty-eight days. Now, let us focus on the data which is clinically the most relevant-ADAS cog, and NPI. A valid criticism of the twelve-month OLE data is that it is open-label, susceptible to placebo effect. However, a more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect highly probable and Placebo effect unlikely.   A  The disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a    A follow-up meta-analysis by  Simufilams ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above:   The data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable. Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. So, if a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-cog at twelve months or greater, this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature. We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below. Taking a closer look at the delta between the above cohorts and the OLE ADAS-cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. By my estimation, this can not be explained by placebo. Suppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes phase three a foregone conclusion, in my opinion.   As mentioned above, behavioral disturbances are the explicit reason families abandon their loved ones in the ER. Caregiver stress is cited in ""Alzheimer's facts and figures"" as having numerous unfavorable outcomes. Worse, physicians are often forced to use antipsychotics for dementia-related psychosis and agitation, which increases the risk of death in the elderly. Restraints (a generous way of referring to tying patients to the bed) are an unfortunate last resort used in the hospital setting to prevent patients from harming themselves and staff. Simufilam use resulted in markedly fewer behavior disturbances, and this data continues to improve with time. Fast-tracking a medication after a single-arm study would not be an unprecedented action by the FDA. As Ke Liu, MD, PhD cites  As is known, the cognitive data was collected over sixteen clinical sites across the US and Canada by independent Physician PI's and associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). The chain of custody was made transparent and verified by independent biostatisticians. AD claims the lives of 13 patients every hour, and if the FDA allows phase three trials to continue for two years, then we risk the deaths of over 240,000 patients. As functional status is an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality. I believe by preserving cognitive function, Simufilam will also preserve functional status (as the two are highly correlated). It may take years to see a mortality benefit, but waiting years in the setting of limited risk is unacceptable. I and my cosigners are humbly and optimistically submitting this Citizens Petition to review m my risk-benefit analysis. I look forward to the FDA's correspondence.

I review these weighty problems with the FDA to help frame my logic and construct a petition for why Simufilam must be expediently granted accelerated approval and advanced to phase 4 post-marketing surveillance. After reviewing the FDA's mission statement, I am operating on the premise that the FDA evaluates medications based on    Simufilam has been administered to patients across 5 trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03748706, NCT04079803, NCT04932655, NCT04388254, NCT04388254). More precisely, 39,620 doses of Simufilam were administered from the publicly available data, with no reported serious  In addition, there are 150 patients enrolled in the ""open-label extension trial"" (OLE). They do not have publicly available information; however, it is reasonable to assume the FDA is privy to safety data. The standard protocol requires study sites to report serious adverse events immediately to the FDA. Those OLE patients were administered another 109,500 doses. Factoring in the OLE patients, in totality,   Data associated with Simufilam has been remarkably consistent. A 28 day multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 64 patients measured:  Cassava Sciences stated:  Open-label Extension data tested:  Tallied up, we have 34 different measures over twelve months and twenty-eight days. Now, let us focus on the data which is clinically the most relevant-ADAS cog, and NPI. A valid criticism of the twelve-month OLE data is that it is open-label, susceptible to placebo effect. However, a more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect highly probable and Placebo effect unlikely.   A  The disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a    A follow-up meta-analysis by  Simufilams ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above:   The data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable. Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. So, if a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-cog at twelve months or greater, this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature. We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below. Taking a closer look at the delta between the above cohorts and the OLE ADAS-cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. By my estimation, this can not be explained by placebo. Suppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes phase three a foregone conclusion, in my opinion.   As mentioned above, behavioral disturbances are the explicit reason families abandon their loved ones in the ER. Caregiver stress is cited in ""Alzheimer's facts and figures"" as having numerous unfavorable outcomes. Worse, physicians are often forced to use antipsychotics for dementia-related psychosis and agitation, which increases the risk of death in the elderly. Restraints (a generous way of referring to tying patients to the bed) are an unfortunate last resort used in the hospital setting to prevent patients from harming themselves and staff. Simufilam use resulted in markedly fewer behavior disturbances, and this data continues to improve with time. Fast-tracking a medication after a single-arm study would not be an unprecedented action by the FDA. As Ke Liu, MD, PhD cites  As is known, the cognitive data was collected over sixteen clinical sites across the US and Canada by independent Physician PI's and associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). The chain of custody was made transparent and verified by independent biostatisticians. AD claims the lives of 13 patients every hour, and if the FDA allows phase three trials to continue for two years, then we risk the deaths of over 240,000 patients. As functional status is an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality. I believe by preserving cognitive function, Simufilam will also preserve functional status (as the two are highly correlated). It may take years to see a mortality benefit, but waiting years in the setting of limited risk is unacceptable. I and my cosigners are humbly and optimistically submitting this Citizens Petition to review m my risk-benefit analysis. I look forward to the FDA's correspondence.

I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play. Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider. Positions: 11/05 86c"

It's exhausting now as everything now is considered a ""short squeeze"" but I would like shed some light on relatively safe plays and reasoning behind it. This methodology will always change based on data presented. The #1 rule in this is that you don't want to chase on plays that are being run. What I do for myself is to get in plays based on data/method that are not running (pre-squeeze), scale into the stock, wait for the catalysts, and then scale out of the stock once it starts running. See below: Methodology/Criteria:  a. The first requirement is the stock must be close to a 52 week low or close/below the 200 MA- you can also follow the YTD Change %. You want to make sure you are buying value and not stocks that are down because they are truly terrible companies. b. The second requirement is the stock must have catalysts in the short term horizon- this allows for anticipation of upside and call option flow. The most % of money I ever made was purchasing stocks/calls in their pre-squeeze stage before they actually squeezed. This way you don't get IV crushed while chasing but as the IV builds, you gain massively on calls. If you are purchasing calls when the IV is at or less than 90% and a catalyst hits that takes the IV >130%, these are massive gains. c. The third requirement is that the stock float must be shorted >30%. Low float stocks aren't a requirement although they help in certain situations. d. The 4th requirement are technicals. The one set up I always play is a falling wedge as long as it meets the requirements above. I also love playing cup and handles and bull flags as they are the most consistent. I do not play symmetrical triangles or wedges- I feel as though these are more unpredictable. e. The other dataset that I look at are call/put ratio and open interest on call options. This can tell you how bullish or bearish generally the market is for the future. A large amount of OI on calls means people are anticipating something significant. 4) Scale In with stock/call purchases based on risk/reward ratio. Make sure to SCALE IN. This doesn't mean purchasing all at one time. I usually purchase not in time increments but in % decrease increments (on average -5%) to be safe and purchase 90% stock / 10% calls (>3 months out) to scale in below based on my own risk management. If I want to go riskier/higher reward, I will increase the amount of calls or shorten the call expiration date. But I strongly advise purchasing calls >3 month out exp. i.e. Day 1: 90% stock / 10% calls (20% of capital) and then repeat when the stock price drops 5%. If the stock price jumps, I don't scale up as many might do. I just move onto another play. Holding CASH is always a position. 5) Once the catalyst hits or there is upside to the stock, I scale out of my positions/gains (not all at one time). Make sure you follow volume - if the volume is strong, you can hold onto your positions much longer to get maximum ROI. 6) Rinse, repeat, and share with others on your plays. The stock that I am most interested in right now is $ROOT and I've evaluated the others- please feel free to drop in comments what you would like for me to evaluate. Right now it is the #4 most shorted stock on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks. I will let you know my thoughts on the others in the comments thread and why $ROOT is better vs. others like $SDC. I do look at basic fundamentals to help my game and I do see that $ROOT has $1B in cash while trading at a market cap of $1.5B. They do have a catalyst on the horizon which is their Carvana partnership launch date, other insurance programs such as home insurace, etc. (haven't gotten hit by negative news except earnings), and for a reach, partnerships with electrical vehicle companies like $TSLA. The fact is that only telematics can truly determine how electric vehicle drivers drive instead of their credit scores, etc. and it's very difficult in getting insurance state by state. Short Interest is at 35%. Technically, they are in a falling wedge with it getting tighter- this is when I like to go riskier on calls as you could see a significant breakout. Let me know your thoughts and I will answer questions that you may have! *Edit 1: Hypothetically taking a position at $5.67/share price and March $7.5 2022 calls at $1.30 as of 9/27/21.

Here are the results!,"There is an old saying on Wall Street.  If you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up! It‚Äôs not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO‚Äôs, VP‚Äôs, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon? In this week‚Äôs analysis let‚Äôs put this to the test.      The data for this analysis was taken from  it‚Äôs a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 [1]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.  The financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.      For all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months & 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&P500 over the same time period. My hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.      Surprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year. I have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.  But the number of trades that made positive returns shows a different story. When compared to trading SPY, a lesser number of trades would have generated profits in the case of following insider purchases. The key here is that while the chances of your trading making a profit is lower, if it does end up making a profit, you would generally have had a better return than the market.     There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.      Usually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it‚Äôs time to get out of that market. This analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information [4]. You may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!

Is this GFC 2.0, featuring our new friend the Orphan SPV?","Ok, so I have done a little research on this topic, and what the fallout from Evergrande could look like. I was bouncing around on twitter and I saw Michael Burry was getting all worked up about Evergrande. Now, I have no background in finance other than a personal interest in learning, but from my limited understanding I could not see anything at first in the information he linked and from other sources to that would point to a widespread collapse like he was claiming. I mean, Evergrande is big, but they hold $300+ billion in assets. Even if they are forced to restructure the losses could not be that bad globally right?  They only have about $18 Billion in foreign bonds outstanding on the international market, how could that lead to a global crash? Sure, the slowdown in China overall as a result will cause pain to some countries, like Australia, but not a global crash right? So I did a little more digging, and one of the things the data Burry linked to very specifically in his tweet said to look at the dates, in relation to the bonds starting to devalue in May this year. Well, thanks to the power of google, I learn that in May China started to crack down on 'shadow lending' or 'off the books lending' right when their public bonds started to turn to dog poo. And here we go, the rabbit hole. What the hell is shadow lending? Well, it all starts with this little policy China introduced in August last year to slow down the growth of their insane property markets. It is called the three line policy. I won't bore you with the details, google exists, go use it if you want. The TL;DR is if developers in China cross these lines in how much debt they have compared to assets, the amount of new debt they can take on is restricted. You cross all three, you turn red and can no longer grow the amount of debt you have. At least not on the books anyway... Evergrande crossed that line last year, it has not been allowed to 'legally' grow the amount of debt it has since then. Bring in the shadow banking system! The orphan special purpose vehicle. From my understanding, this system works much like this. Evergrande spins up what is called an orphan special purpose vehicle, this SPV, if it is based offshore, does not need to follow the laws in place in regards to the three red lines. Evergrande can then use the funds in that SPV like they would a loan, but without having to declare it on their books at all, they don't technically own the debt, some other fake business in say, the Caymans does in return for interest that Evergrande just happens to pay (or not). So, what does this mean?! Well... this is what I think Burry and others have been attempting to warn us about. What we know about the extent of Foreign debt in China is only the tip of the iceberg. Evergrande and other developers in China may hold much higher international liabilities than anyone is aware of, these SPV's are off the books, unrelated to Evergrande in any way other than being a source of liquidity for them to use. Who paid in to these SPV's? What is the total value of debt outstanding? If they get restructured will they repay these SPV's? No one knows... Well, some people do, but they are not talking. Ever since they have been restricted from issuing new bonds, or taking out loans, they have had to have been getting cash from somewhere and their asset sales are simply not enough to cover their costs to continue to grow, especially at the discounted prices recently. I know this is a wall of text but I think this might be very important and could be why some of the largest international investment funds have been in talks with Evergrande and the CCP. This problem could be much larger than anyone knows. Many international entities may have much more exposure to Evergrande and other aspects of the Chinese real estate market than anyone understands and when they get restructured those SPV investors will certainly be left holding the bag. Is this literally GFC 2.0, did those hedge funds and investment firms get greedy again and try to take a larger slice of the massive $50 Trillion dollar Chinese real estate market with SPVs? Is that what has Burry and others all worked up? Am I being incredibly 'Smooth brain' and missing something key here? Please let me know because I am more than a little concerned now.","I think I worked out what has had Burry and others worked up about Evergrande.

Amazon first began building its current 75-plane fleet, which is flown by private contractors, in 2016. The majority of flights by company-owned planes are between U.S. airports. Are the cargo pilots working under union contracts? Given the increased cargo volume and the limited supply of pilots; this could be an important expense factor. Southwest Airlines is now experiencing the wage pressure effects from its pilots.","Who are AMZN private contractors flying their cargo planes?

So what's going on? Well... Lucid is having a PR event at their AZ factory this week. Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.      LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!  -------  Credits for this DD, and a shoutout, goes to    Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone*. In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the  In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase*, with early construction already having begun*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes*. Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence*.   ------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ∂   ------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ∂   Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.       Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly  For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density. It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week. Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips‚Äîit also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by    ------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ∂     *US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*    Project Gravity SUV  ------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ∂  Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to ~20kW and DC charging up to ~300kW.  Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system. Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology. -------------------------------------------------------------  Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum√©s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands.

Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.      LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!  -------  Credits for this DD, and a shoutout, goes to    Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone*. In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the  In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase*, with early construction already having begun*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes*. Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence*.   ------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ∂   ------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ∂   Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.       Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly  For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density. It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week. Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips‚Äîit also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by    ------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ∂     *US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now*    Project Gravity SUV  ------------------------------------------------------------- ‚ñ∂  Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to ~20kW and DC charging up to ~300kW.  Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system. Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology. -------------------------------------------------------------  Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resum√©s from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands.

It's exhausting now as everything now is considered a ""short squeeze"" but I would like shed some light on relatively safe plays and reasoning behind it. This methodology will always change based on data presented. The #1 rule in this is that you don't want to chase on plays that are being run. What I do for myself is to get in plays based on data/method that are not running (pre-squeeze), scale into the stock, wait for the catalysts, and then scale out of the stock once it starts running. See below: Methodology/Criteria:  a. The first requirement is the stock must be close to a 52 week low or close/below the 200 MA- you can also follow the YTD Change %. You want to make sure you are buying value and not stocks that are down because they are truly terrible companies. b. The second requirement is the stock must have catalysts in the short term horizon- this allows for anticipation of upside and call option flow. The most % of money I ever made was purchasing stocks/calls in their pre-squeeze stage before they actually squeezed. This way you don't get IV crushed while chasing but as the IV builds, you gain massively on calls. If you are purchasing calls when the IV is at or less than 90% and a catalyst hits that takes the IV >130%, these are massive gains. c. The third requirement is that the stock float must be shorted >30%. Low float stocks aren't a requirement although they help in certain situations. d. The 4th requirement are technicals. The one set up I always play is a falling wedge as long as it meets the requirements above. I also love playing cup and handles and bull flags as they are the most consistent. I do not play symmetrical triangles or wedges- I feel as though these are more unpredictable. e. The other dataset that I look at are call/put ratio and open interest on call options. This can tell you how bullish or bearish generally the market is for the future. A large amount of OI on calls means people are anticipating something significant. 4) Scale In with stock/call purchases based on risk/reward ratio. Make sure to SCALE IN. This doesn't mean purchasing all at one time. I usually purchase not in time increments but in % decrease increments (on average -5%) to be safe and purchase 90% stock / 10% calls (>3 months out) to scale in below based on my own risk management. If I want to go riskier/higher reward, I will increase the amount of calls or shorten the call expiration date. But I strongly advise purchasing calls >3 month out exp. i.e. Day 1: 90% stock / 10% calls (20% of capital) and then repeat when the stock price drops 5%. If the stock price jumps, I don't scale up as many might do. I just move onto another play. Holding CASH is always a position. 5) Once the catalyst hits or there is upside to the stock, I scale out of my positions/gains (not all at one time). Make sure you follow volume - if the volume is strong, you can hold onto your positions much longer to get maximum ROI. 6) Rinse, repeat, and share with others on your plays. The stock that I am most interested in right now is $ROOT and I've evaluated the others- please feel free to drop in comments what you would like for me to evaluate. Right now it is the #4 most shorted stock on MarketWatch and HighShortInterestStocks. I will let you know my thoughts on the others in the comments thread and why $ROOT is better vs. others like $SDC.

They do have a catalyst on the horizon which is their Carvana partnership launch date, other insurance programs such as home insurace, etc. (haven't gotten hit by negative news except earnings), and for a reach, partnerships with electrical vehicle companies like $TSLA. The fact is that only telematics can truly determine how electric vehicle drivers drive instead of their credit scores, etc. and it's very difficult in getting insurance state by state. Short Interest is at 35%. Technically, they are in a falling wedge with it getting tighter- this is when I like to go riskier on calls as you could see a significant breakout.

They do have a catalyst on the horizon which is their Carvana partnership launch date, other insurance programs such as home insurace, etc. (haven't gotten hit by negative news except earnings), and for a reach, partnerships with electrical vehicle companies like $TSLA. The fact is that only telematics can truly determine how electric vehicle drivers drive instead of their credit scores, etc. and it's very difficult in getting insurance state by state. Short Interest is at 35%. Technically, they are in a falling wedge with it getting tighter- this is when I like to go riskier on calls as you could see a significant breakout. Let me know your thoughts and I will answer questions that you may have! *Edit 1: Hypothetically taking a position at $5.67/share price and March $7.5 2022 calls at $1.30 as of 9/27/21. Let's see how this does based on methodology. Not sure if there will be a 5% decrease but we'll watch.  $ROOT Technicals as of 9/27: Higher volume starting to come in as highlighted and MACD is about to breakout. "

These periods tend to experience movements and volatility that can make for good opportunities in options trading. These types of trades are also riskier than other periods because of a lot of factors playing against you, like time decay and especially the IV crush that happens after the release, making most bought options worthless by itself. Like most things, the market prices-in the expected volatility and movements of the stock prices around earnings. By studying iv and other factors, one can actually estimate this market expectation. Usually traders prefer to be on the sell side of options before earnings to take advantage of the iv crush and a stock price movement that stays within the market expectation. However, a lot of stocks end up beating this expected move for a multitude of reasons: way better or worse results ending in investors adjusting their positions, but also a detail in the report or guidance can shift expectations, and anyway the stock ends up moving more than expected move. This make for very profitable options trades when we are on the buy side and we actually hold through earnings. The goal here is to spot these companies. Idea The main idea of the approach here is to let the data speak for itself. The end goal is to build a classification model that ‚Äúspots‚Äù companies likely to beat market expectation, First we need to define that expectation. A first approximation can be to consider the average of the historic moves and add some offset as a multiplier of its standard variation. If we are able to predict if a company is likely to move higher than what it used to do it can be a first clue to look deeper and assess options opportunities. Features Since I‚Äôm not aiming at predicting a particular direction of movement, I will be mostly using features that reflect the market behaviour around earnings for every stock. I will use 3 categories of features: -  Sector of activity, market cap, size of shareholders, time since ipo, .. -   -   Target Now that we have all these indicators going back to 2015, we can add the target we will be looking for. We are interested in an actual stock move that outperforms the expected one, that we define it to be the average of historic move. For each date, we can then average the previous movements and set our classification to target to either 1 if the actual absolute move is higher than the average at that point and 0 otherwise. We end up with a dataset of +300k releases and approximately 30% of the observations have a positive target. Model The next step is to actually train our machine learning model and study the results. A lot of important data-science steps are involved that I will not dive into, for example we need our model to not overfit and actually be able to compare the results versus a random model and use a score metric that actually makes sense.

About INDI Indie  Semiconductor, Inc. provides automotive semiconductors and software  solutions. It offers its solution for advanced driver assistance  systems, including light detection and ranging, connected car, user  experience, and electrification applications. EV  stocks such as TSLA, LCID, and NIO are mainstream yet not much focus is  put on the providers of components and tech related to them. It is important to look also into the companies that provide all these  essential components and $INDI is the perfect company for this.  2. The Set-up To summarize INDI:   3. deezSpacs:  There  is currently lower gamma but growing OI as the volume has steadily  crept up over the past 5 days. This is what is causing the options to be  cheaper. Due to the low float it is likely to see significantly  increased volatility which will increase the IV on the options. You can  see evidence of the low float with the price action between yesterday  and today relative to the low volume. Today $INDI is up 10% yet the IV  has barely moved up by 11% to the 60% range on the October calls with an  expected movement of $1.2 in either direction. The main risk is a  smaller gamma ramp, but given the MMs do not seem to be hedging  properly, I think this acts as a solid ‚Äúarbitrage‚Äù play. A  lot of people ignored VLTA because it had a ""high float"" of 10,277,713  shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to  IRNT (~1.3m), TMC (~2.7m), OPAD (~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number. But  there's also a significant amount of OI to make up for and like we all  know, what really matters for gamma is the ratio of OI to float. So  currently, if we take the redemption proceeds and current float data  from Ortex, we can calculate the following:  $400M Proceeds -  96M Shares * 5274% Free Float =   UPDATE: as   So  The Implied Vol Why  isn‚Äôt IV on IRNT as high as other deSPAC stocks? Let‚Äôs take a look at  other deSPACs that have been popular on reddit and compare INDI‚Äôs IV to  theirs:   INDI  10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around ~65% IV right now. Even further  OTM, $17.50's are sitting at ~100%. This is still a low IV compared to  ATM options on the other deSPACs. Most plays like $VLTA also had a  higher IV before the play was known of.  Order Flow & SI Stats: The  past few weeks have shown very strong buying pressure. Today INDI  currently sits at over an 8% gain. Since August, INDI is up about 30%.  Options flows are also very strong, with volume picking up drastically  on October calls. Looking at Ortex,   I have tagged  Positions: So how do I trade this? Like all trades, this has risk. However, based on  the data, it is highly likely that the rewards outweigh the risks. With  the current price action we are seeing in deSPACs, INDI is a very smart  bet, especially considering INDI is up 8% today and has decent gamma,  yet IV did not change. For that reason, current positions are a mix of  shares and options. INDI has a strong core business model, which  suffices the shares. For the technical deSPAC trade, options provide a  massive risk:reward. ","$INDI Semi-Conductor, an unknown deSPAC with Low IV, Gamma Ramp, Low Float 1.

This is what is causing the options to be  cheaper. Due to the low float it is likely to see significantly  increased volatility which will increase the IV on the options. You can  see evidence of the low float with the price action between yesterday  and today relative to the low volume. Today $INDI is up 10% yet the IV  has barely moved up by 11% to the 60% range on the October calls with an  expected movement of $1.2 in either direction. The main risk is a  smaller gamma ramp, but given the MMs do not seem to be hedging  properly, I think this acts as a solid ‚Äúarbitrage‚Äù play. A  lot of people ignored VLTA because it had a ""high float"" of 10,277,713  shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to  IRNT (~1.3m), TMC (~2.7m), OPAD (~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number. But  there's also a significant amount of OI to make up for and like we all  know, what really matters for gamma is the ratio of OI to float. So  currently, if we take the redemption proceeds and current float data  from Ortex, we can calculate the following:  $400M Proceeds -  96M Shares * 5274% Free Float =   UPDATE: as   So  The Implied Vol Why  isn‚Äôt IV on IRNT as high as other deSPAC stocks? Let‚Äôs take a look at  other deSPACs that have been popular on reddit and compare INDI‚Äôs IV to  theirs:   INDI  10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around ~65% IV right now. Even further  OTM, $17.50's are sitting at ~100%. This is still a low IV compared to  ATM options on the other deSPACs. Most plays like $VLTA also had a  higher IV before the play was known of.  Order Flow & SI Stats: The  past few weeks have shown very strong buying pressure. Today INDI  currently sits at over an 8% gain. Since August, INDI is up about 30%.  Options flows are also very strong, with volume picking up drastically  on October calls. Looking at Ortex,   I have tagged  Positions: So how do I trade this? Like all trades, this has risk. However, based on  the data, it is highly likely that the rewards outweigh the risks. With  the current price action we are seeing in deSPACs, INDI is a very smart  bet, especially considering INDI is up 8% today and has decent gamma,  yet IV did not change. For that reason, current positions are a mix of  shares and options. INDI has a strong core business model, which  suffices the shares. For the technical deSPAC trade, options provide a  massive risk:reward. "

2021-10-18 13:33:06.934186,NFLX,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,16.0,u/Lost-Guarantee229,Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate,"There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù. Squid Games has quickly become an international sensation after reaching 111M+ global viewers in more than 200 different countries. Squid games has brought a lot of hype to Netflix (and their original content) and has set the stage for an interesting Q3 2021 earnings report for their stock investors. Today, I am here to predict how Netflix‚Äôs Q3 earnings report will go, and a large part of this will be focusing on the growth of their platform in the past quarter due to their hit show ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù. At the end of this analysis, you will find a   Firstly, as we know, Squid Games had reached over 111M global users in over 200 countries in the past month alone. This in and of itself is impressive, however factoring in their low production cost of $21.4M makes it exponentially more impressive. Squid Games was able to keep these costs low due to filming in South Korea (Internationally) which allows for actors to work longer hours and can bring the cost of production down. Top executives have predicted that the cost to shoot domestically (in Hollywood) would have been 5-10x more than Netflix‚Äôs cost of production. This series in particular has opened the floodgates for streaming services to shoot internationally, as many of them are now starting to express interest in it. Squid Games was a huge money maker for Netflix and has been estimated to be worth in the ballpark of $900M, which represents a return on their investment (production) of over 4,100%. Considering Netflix‚Äôs revenues last quarter were $7.3B, Squid Games is likely to represent a large percentage of their revenues in Q3, and since their margins are so impressive, it is likely that we see Squid Games have a role to play in Netflix having better margins on their upcoming earnings.  The most important factor that I derived from Netflix‚Äôs Q2 2021 financial report is the fact that their weighted average subscription price across all of their regions is $12.26. This will be very important in determining the revenues in Q3 2021. Furthermore, Netflix‚Äôs revenues in Q2 2021 were $7.34B, and their cost of revenues was $4.02B (54.73% of revenues).   I am basing Netflix‚Äôs revenues off of their previous revenues, plus the new revenues that are brought in by additional subscribers in this quarter. Firstly, to get the new subscriber figures I decided to take Netflix‚Äôs estimate of 3.5M in this quarter for the first 3 months, due to squid games not being added. This resulted in 900k new subscribers per month for the first 3 months, which adds up to 2.7M new subscribers in June, July, and August. Lastly, we needed the new subscribers for the month of September. This was more difficult to calculate as they released Squid Games this month which drove in far more traffic than usual. In order to get a proxy for how many new subscribers a ‚Äúhit‚Äù like Squid Games can bring in, I used the data from Netflix‚Äôs 2nd biggest show ‚ÄúBridgerton.‚Äù Like Squid Games, Bridgerton was released 1 month prior to their earnings report, and helped Netflix to beat their new subscriber estimates by 41%. However, since squid games is 50% more popular than Bridgerton was in their first month, I think it is reasonable to estimate that Squid Games can help Netflix beat their Q3 2021 new subscriber estimates by 61.5%. Increasing Netflix‚Äôs Q3 subscriber figures yield 5.65M new subscribers over the whole quarter. This means that in September, Netflix likely brought in 2.95M new subscribers mostly off of the success of Squid Games. Overall, if Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers June, their revenue generated for the quarter would be $44.32M (900000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in July, their revenues generated for the quarter would be $33.1M (900,000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in August, their revenues for the quarter would be $22.07M (900,000*$12.26*2 months). Lastly, if Netflix brought in 2.95M subscribers in September as a result of Squid Games, their quarterly revenues would be $36.16M. In total, it is reasonable to assume Netflix increased their revenues by $136.22M, bringing their Q3 revenues to $7.48B. However, Netflix has been reported to have increased their prices by $1 in many regions. To be conservative, we can assume a $0.50 increase across all regions, which would result in a 4% increase on average prices. This would then cause Netflix‚Äôs quarterly revenues to be 4% higher, totalling $7.78B. This would represent earnings beat of 0.28B (or 3.7%).  As previously mentioned, Squid Games is very likely to have increased Netflix‚Äôs margins. As a result of this we can conservatively estimate that Netflix‚Äôs cost of revenues is 54% of their revenues (as opposed to 54.73% in Q2 2021). By doing this their cost of revenues should be $4.2B  Assuming that Netflix‚Äôs other costs are the same % of revenues as they were in the previous quarter, we can estimate all of these other expenses to total $1.56B.  If these assumptions are correct, then Netflix‚Äôs operating income for Q3 2021 should be $2.01B.  Assuming Netflix‚Äôs Net Income to Operating Income ratio is the same (over the past 6 months), we can estimate that Netflix‚Äôs Q3 Net Income figure to be $1.25B.  Since Netflix has 442.6M shares outstanding, their diluted EPS should be $2.74. This would represent a 7% EPS  I think that Netflix is going to narrowly beat earnings, which in theory should be good for the stock. However, since Squid Games was released, the stock has been up 6-7%. As a result, I think that NFLX will not have a big reaction from their earnings. I think that they might open the next trading day (October 20th) up between 0-1% and close the day between -0.5% and +0.5%. If I am correct, then the best way that I could think to play this via iron condors. I think that a 600/615/635/650 iron condor would be suitable given ","Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù.
