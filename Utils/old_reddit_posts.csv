In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real. Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again.

2021-11-10 10:52:34.136766,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/NeedCookies8,"Nov 4th, Schwab Market Data Massive Lag. I should really switch to Fidelity.","So I've been a Charles Schwab user since August of last year, 2020. I've been really thinking about moving to Fidelity for the last few months. I don't know why I don't just move my accounts to Fidelity. Schwab has a good platform (could be better), is a bank, the color blue lol but not a reason, Schwab gives me leniency with trading for the $25k rule and more, and good customer service but so does Fidelity I've heard. Schwab just feels easy and comfortable because I've basically been using them since I've been investing. Throughout this year I've been considering moving to Fidelity because there have been some small things that have happened with StreetSmart Edge and just trading with Schwab in general. I do day trade and also do long-term investing. There have been times where it has taken 10 seconds to a few minutes for my cost basis/ cost per share to pop up on the screen and I have lost out on money and lost money because of this before. I'd put up with it about 6-8 months ago when that happened and hasn't happened since. It happened a few times. I haven't run into that problems since then, mainly because I haven't been placing trades as often as I used to. Something happened last week though with Schwab's desktop trading app and updating market data. Last week though... this is really what has gotten to me and honestly, when this happened I was really pissed and shocked at what was going. I sort of had no idea what to think. I called customer service after this happened, and they took down what I had to say and looked into it with the tech division or whatever division that handles market matching data. They didn't call me back after I asked them to, it was fixed a few minutes later and didn't happen again. I took a couple of screenshots of my trading screen of SSE alongside by side with Fidelity's Active Trader Pro Trading app. I saved another screenshot along with this one, but deleted the other picture (thankfully I saved at least one screenshot I took) because at the time I was going to post here on Reddit about it, but decided not to at the time because 1) I didn't have time, 2) I thought it would be taken care of (which it was), 3) it was fixed so thought it wasn't an issue anymore and it remains not an issue, and 4) because I was lazy that day/ last week and deferred writing this post until tonight. Since the 4th of November last week I have forgotten about it a little, but has been in the back of my mind since, so I am writing this now. Maybe this was just a small issue/ glitch in the system at the moment and isn't how Schwab runs things on their servers. Possibly this is a stupid post, but I don't think so. So onto it.. Last week on November 4th, I had Fidelity's Active Trader Pro and Schwab's SSE programs up to look at the market data because I've noticed all the time that Schwab doesn't print the time and sales for all transactions while Fidelity does. Schwab updates the current bids and asks that are at the top of the ask/ bid table along with the other bids and asks (that match with Fidelity, other than Schwab that does lump together orders for the same price mostly), but then doesn't print all of the sales in premarket and I'm sure for the market times as well. I have direct trading and level 2 data. Sometimes during market hours, I notice this. Maybe I don't have all of the exchanges listed for the printing of sales or something. There will be transactions that Schwab doesn't print that Fidelity prints. So, when I want to sell something I am thinking of the wrong price to sell it at because I am seeing a sell at a certain price and thinking, oh I'll set my limit to this price, even though Schwab is listing the current bid and ask, but the time and sales aren't being listed. So I set my limit to a price near the bid of the last price usually and also look at the bid and it fills and I wonder why my sell is a higher price than what I am seeing for the last time and sales, same with buying. This is because Schwab doesn't list all of the time and sales, so I am not getting all of the current market data to put orders in. I'm sure the sales of my orders go for what the market is going for at the best price since I cannot see all the time and sales on Schwab, and Fidelity shows the price I can see that it's the best price at the time of my order fill. Okay... back to what I am here to write about. Nov 4th, around 10:15ish AM EST to about 10:19-20ish AM EST, I was looking at Microsoft, MSFT, and Apple, APPL, between SSE and Active Trader Pro. Schwab was showing prices were selling for between $0-2 lower and higher depending on if the candle was green or red, compared to Fidelity. I was timing Fidelity's and Schwab's price action and Schwab was about 20 seconds or so behind in updating what Fidelity was showing, if not more. I manually timed the change in price to Fidelity and that's where I get 20 seconds. This all was happening fast so it was hard to document. I should have screen recorded, but I didn't think of that at the time. In the picture below it shows Fidelity keeping up with the time and sales of the current time and Schwab is 12 minutes behind on the time and sales, but Schwab is only 12 minutes behind on the time part. Schwab was still over a $1 difference than what Fidelity was showing, and this was between $0-$2 difference, the difference fluctuated throughout this 4-5 minute window I was looking at MSFT and AAPL. I only show MSFT here because I only took a screenshot of MSFT. I was looking on the Schwab mobile app, Fidelity's mobile app, and as well as the prices on the internet, Fidelity was showing the right prices. Through these 4-5 minutes, the real price did change $0-2 on Fidelity because of well trading, which was the real price in my eyes. Schwab was behind on the prices.. when AAPL or MSFT was showing green on Fidelity $0-2 change from the opening candle, Schwab was showing red and $0-2 change from its opening candle. Then the opposite was for a red candle on Fidelity.. Schwab was showing a green candle and $0-2 change. It was more towards $1.50 change, there was $2 difference I could see, but not a lot of trades during this time so roughly $1-1.50 was noticeable, but there were trades $2 apart I saw. Schwab's software seems to not be the greatest, or at least just a massive lag during this time. I wish I just recorded my screen because it would have been much better to express what was going on. I loaded up the ""Snipping Tool"" and chose a ""2 second time delay"" for the snipping tool to freeze the screen so I could refresh all of the time and sales window total history for Fidelity before the screen froze. Fidelity's time and sale tape are also visible, I just thought it would be good to have the time and total history sales up as well. As you can see in the photo below on the right is StreetSmart Edge and on the left is Active Trader Pro. The current time was 9:18 AM CST time for me, so 10:18 AM EST trading time. Schwab is displaying time and sales at 10:06 AM EST while Fidelity is showing 10:18 AM EST which was the current time. Fidelity shows MSFT at the last trade price of roughly $335.22, while Schwab is showing a price of $334.055, while the bid was at $334.04 and ask at $334.06 for Schwab. Fidelity was also showing a bid and ask price around what the real price was going for which was roughly $335.22 at the time. I whited out too much info for the Fidelity side by accident because my account number was showing and I was planning on keeping extra copies of my screenshot but that didn't happen, so this is the only copy I have that I whited out. You cannot see Fidelity's bid/ask prices here, as well as the last traded price of the time and sale tape, but you can see the last traded price above for the total history. Looks like there was an update to the sales when I refreshed the history sales and the time and sales tape, or the total history was faster than the tape. I assure you the bid and ask for Fidelity was around the last traded price of MSFT which was $335.22. Either way, the price for Fidelity is more right and Schwab was Drastically behind. Even though Schwab had the wrong time on their time and sales by 12 minutes the chart was showing being updated to the right time frame, but the prices were off. In this instance, the price difference was $335.22-$334.055 = $1.165. The price was off by more at other times, but for this screenshot, it was $1.165. I wish I recorded the screen because it would have shown all of the information and would have been better to see what was going on I can tell you that for sure! Fidelity Green or Red by $0-2 and Schwab the opposite by $0-2. I told this information to a Schwab Broker and the problem was fixed after about 10:20 AM EST, but still, this isn't cool. I compared SSE's information with AAPL and MSFT with Fidelity's platform and all was good I believe after 10:20 AM EST. I still checked throughout the day between the two platforms just to make sure, and everything did line up after 10:20 AM EST. Although minutes don't matter in terms of weeks or month-long trading or holding long term if you're day trading or short term trading this matters. I shouldn't be day trading or short-term trading, but I am to make money, and because I want to. This isn't what I want to be seeing from my broker. I should switch to Fidelity after having to experience this. I have used Schwab for my brokerage, Roth IRA, and checking accounts, but maybe it's time for a change. Schwab does have a great platform but it could use updating. I am sure that'll happen when they merge TDA's platform with SSE.   TL:DR: On November 4th, from roughly 10:15 AM to 10:20 AM EST I was comparing Schwab's bid & ask and time & sales to Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform. I compared AAPL and MSFT information, I only took a screenshot of MSFT. Schwab was showing different data in terms of pricing by shown here at $1.165 difference. I was seeing a difference in about $0-2 in sales pricing. I have only one screenshot. I whited out some info but whited out too much info here because I had other copies of my screenshots but accidentally deleted them. Schwab fixed their market prices after I called them, but still not good to be happening on their platform. It's not like this was happening on purpose, it's just something that was happening with Schwab's services. I have used Schwab for mainly all of my investment accounts, but maybe it's time to move. I do like Schwab a lot though. After this, I should probably switch.  Hopefully this isn't taken down lol. I haven't had a post on WSB before and it would be cool to not have this taken down, so people can see why Fidelity is better!","Nov 4th, Schwab Market Data Massive Lag.

It was more towards $1.50 change, there was $2 difference I could see, but not a lot of trades during this time so roughly $1-1.50 was noticeable, but there were trades $2 apart I saw. Schwab's software seems to not be the greatest, or at least just a massive lag during this time. I wish I just recorded my screen because it would have been much better to express what was going on. I loaded up the ""Snipping Tool"" and chose a ""2 second time delay"" for the snipping tool to freeze the screen so I could refresh all of the time and sales window total history for Fidelity before the screen froze. Fidelity's time and sale tape are also visible, I just thought it would be good to have the time and total history sales up as well. As you can see in the photo below on the right is StreetSmart Edge and on the left is Active Trader Pro. The current time was 9:18 AM CST time for me, so 10:18 AM EST trading time. Schwab is displaying time and sales at 10:06 AM EST while Fidelity is showing 10:18 AM EST which was the current time. Fidelity shows MSFT at the last trade price of roughly $335.22, while Schwab is showing a price of $334.055, while the bid was at $334.04 and ask at $334.06 for Schwab. Fidelity was also showing a bid and ask price around what the real price was going for which was roughly $335.22 at the time. I whited out too much info for the Fidelity side by accident because my account number was showing and I was planning on keeping extra copies of my screenshot but that didn't happen, so this is the only copy I have that I whited out. You cannot see Fidelity's bid/ask prices here, as well as the last traded price of the time and sale tape, but you can see the last traded price above for the total history. Looks like there was an update to the sales when I refreshed the history sales and the time and sales tape, or the total history was faster than the tape. I assure you the bid and ask for Fidelity was around the last traded price of MSFT which was $335.22. Either way, the price for Fidelity is more right and Schwab was Drastically behind. Even though Schwab had the wrong time on their time and sales by 12 minutes the chart was showing being updated to the right time frame, but the prices were off. In this instance, the price difference was $335.22-$334.055 = $1.165. The price was off by more at other times, but for this screenshot, it was $1.165. I wish I recorded the screen because it would have shown all of the information and would have been better to see what was going on I can tell you that for sure! Fidelity Green or Red by $0-2 and Schwab the opposite by $0-2. I told this information to a Schwab Broker and the problem was fixed after about 10:20 AM EST, but still, this isn't cool. I compared SSE's information with AAPL and MSFT with Fidelity's platform and all was good I believe after 10:20 AM EST. I still checked throughout the day between the two platforms just to make sure, and everything did line up after 10:20 AM EST. Although minutes don't matter in terms of weeks or month-long trading or holding long term if you're day trading or short term trading this matters. I shouldn't be day trading or short-term trading, but I am to make money, and because I want to. This isn't what I want to be seeing from my broker. I should switch to Fidelity after having to experience this. I have used Schwab for my brokerage, Roth IRA, and checking accounts, but maybe it's time for a change. Schwab does have a great platform but it could use updating. I am sure that'll happen when they merge TDA's platform with SSE.   TL:DR: On November 4th, from roughly 10:15 AM to 10:20 AM EST I was comparing Schwab's bid & ask and time & sales to Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform. I compared AAPL and MSFT information, I only took a screenshot of MSFT. Schwab was showing different data in terms of pricing by shown here at $1.165 difference. I was seeing a difference in about $0-2 in sales pricing. I have only one screenshot. I whited out some info but whited out too much info here because I had other copies of my screenshots but accidentally deleted them. Schwab fixed their market prices after I called them, but still not good to be happening on their platform. It's not like this was happening on purpose, it's just something that was happening with Schwab's services. I have used Schwab for mainly all of my investment accounts, but maybe it's time to move. I do like Schwab a lot though. After this, I should probably switch.  Hopefully this isn't taken down lol. I haven't had a post on WSB before and it would be cool to not have this taken down, so people can see why Fidelity is better!"

With a market cap of 2.18B, that's  0.4/2.18 = 18% of their whole market cap. THAT IS INSANE. If your tits aren't already perked up from hearing this consider the sharp reduction in shares float. $400M tendies / $21.64 share price = 18.5M shares. Taking this off of shares float is, similarly, an 18% concentration of stock we'll see. If you're still confused I'ma need you to add another wrinkle right now in that peewee brain because what this means is that there will be less sellers and more buyers as more shares are kept with the big boi company itself. Normally this doesn't mean much. AMD is doing a buyback program along with MSFT and several others. So what makes this different? a) the sheer investment/market cap ratio. AMD for example is $4B investment/ 180B market cap = 2%. thats dogshit. and more importantly b) the fact that they want to complete this buyback program by the end of February. The short duration of it is the most critical aspect of this because that means this upward trajectory is going to be aggressive as fuck! And it means it can be calculated. TLDR reasons to buy in:  So whats the play? We're going with the May 20th, 2022 Calls at the $23 strike. I look forward to seeing your posts of thicc gains.","DD inbound - Bullish projections on $BBBY Opportunity to evolve your smooth brains to have at least a few wrinkles so take out your pad, we're diving in.

Converting my small $800 investment into $22,000 within these said 2 weeks. NVDA Price action always follows the same pattern from what I have noticed. We open high and its either push higher or come crashing back down only to recover later during power hour or the following day. For the last 3 trading days NVDA has had some amazing price movements. Giving me the ability to turn 800 into 22 thousand. At one point reaching $42k but as a true autist I did not sell. This stock has given us some amazing returns YOY. For tomorrow we can expect NVDA to break to new ATH (if it is able to break through 314). We can see a very bullish case of 314, 317, 320, 338. I am not saying this will happen tomorrow or the next day. All I am saying is if we break through tomorrow we can make some sweet tendies.   Yesterday I gave a trade idea which I did not take due to going deep into nada. This call out was AMD $145C Nov 12. These were trading at 1 and went up to 10.6 over 2 days. They won MSFT and METAs business. However, I believe that NVDA will run tomorrow since they also have an event regarding their omniverse business. For tomorrow $320 weeklies will be hot. See chart above for a clear view of this bullish pennant. With that I wish you guys luck and lets make some money. Positions: NVDA $320 Nov 12 x 10","NVDA - an autist bullish case Good evening ladies and gents, For the last 2 weeks I have traded NVDA every trading day.
