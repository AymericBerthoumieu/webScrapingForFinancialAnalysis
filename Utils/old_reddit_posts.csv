I was requested by a few users to write an $MU (Micron Technology) DD.           Latest news:  Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks.  MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the   Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron’s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.    Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.            Although you won’t find much correlation in the   Recently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards  Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released,  “The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores,  “ I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron  I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world’s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU’s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use     This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU’s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well.   Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD  “Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions. “Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”  For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‘mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases’). Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of “potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.” Micron believes that “secular growth drivers” such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND.   Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on. “In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a “high level of capital return flexibility,” which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for “competitive reasons,” it will also provide a “safety buffer” for more R&D or CapEx spending.” Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I’ll add more recent figures in the following section).    I will be heavily sourcing from  ‘On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron’s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.’ This fall is due to Micron’s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‘When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.’ The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. ‘Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.’ A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, “The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.” Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‘Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, “Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.”’ ‘The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.’  Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. ‘The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.’  ‘Tipranks’ Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock. The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.’ ‘A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.’      We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off. “     8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)”  ""Current Price: $83.03 Breakout price trigger: $83.80 Buy Zone (Top/Bottom Range): $81.00-$78.00 Price Target: $89.00-$90.00 (1st), $95.00-$97.20 (2nd) Estimated Duration to Target: 45-49d (1st), 60-64d (2nd) Contract of Interest: $MU 12/17/21 82.5c, $MU 1/21/22 85c Trade price as of publish date: $3.75/contract, $4.80/contract""  “MU in upward trend: 10-day moving average moved above 50-day moving average on November 09, 2021 The 10-day Moving Average for MU crossed bullishly above the 50-day moving average on November 09, 2021.

The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‘When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.’ The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. ‘Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.’ A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, “The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.” Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‘Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, “Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.”’ ‘The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.’  Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. ‘The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.’  ‘Tipranks’ Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock. The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.’ ‘A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.’      We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off. “     8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)”  ""Current Price: $83.03 Breakout price trigger: $83.80 Buy Zone (Top/Bottom Range): $81.00-$78.00 Price Target: $89.00-$90.00 (1st), $95.00-$97.20 (2nd) Estimated Duration to Target: 45-49d (1st), 60-64d (2nd) Contract of Interest: $MU 12/17/21 82.5c, $MU 1/21/22 85c Trade price as of publish date: $3.75/contract, $4.80/contract""  “MU in upward trend: 10-day moving average moved above 50-day moving average on November 09, 2021 The 10-day Moving Average for MU crossed bullishly above the 50-day moving average on November 09, 2021.

Yes I'm regarded. I hope my small position assures you this is not a P&D (I hate them), I simply love writing DDs and am trying improve my skill at them (and share my in-depth research).  Look out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.  I think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds.    Part 2: "

What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the brand names in the industry and the investor community for that industry in the market. For example, Apple, it has a strong following in the social media channels and usually positive sentiments on the social media channels about the stock results in a price increase. Today's chart -  Sentiment increase --> Price Increase What you would notice in this chart is that at around 9 AM today the bullish sentiments for APPL started growing on the social channel and this was followed by a price increase a couple of hours later. I also noticed the news about them accelerating their autonomous car, so that contributed to the social chatter on these channels as well. I saw this trend usually in industries where there are established brand names, such as Automotive (TSLA, RIVN), Entertainment (AMC, GME) and Tech. Media (MSFT, FB etc.) But at the same time, industries such as Marijuana, Psychedelics etc. do not really follow this trend. As I try to understand why? one reason that I could think of is that these industries do not have a strong established incumbent and hence do not really have a strong social following. Which further leads me to think that these industries are just scratching the surface of their potential market cap. Another reason that comes to mind is the percentage of the shares that are held by institutions vs individuals. So, for companies and industries where we do not see a price movement following an uptick on social media, would it be safe to assume that most investors are institutions and not individuals. How do you all perceive the social media sentiments and their relation to the stock market for growing industry vs an establish industry? Sorry if the conclusions that I have drawn are very basic and not thorough, but I would appreciate a perspective or some direction to learn more.","Industry incumbents influence on the social media community and stock price movement for the leaders in the industry I recently started investing in the market and started observing certain trends that are prevalent in the market.

Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore. Observations/Assumptions Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.  Hypothesis Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500. Experiment 2020 750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:  For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating. This was done for all of the metrics below:  The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution. Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.  ROE Example ROE Example That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated. This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them? That left 26 across 7 sectors.  Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown  These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.   Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes. Experiment 2021 2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:  More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example: ·  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark. Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution. I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d  need to build a separate model. I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated ~75. We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84.

Me - Bagholder of Warrants @ $4.0  Payoneer vs PayPal  Payoneer is Paypal for B2B global commerce, particularly outside North American and Europe. The company provides B2B services for millions of SMB and enterprises around the world The growth of Payoneer’s global network included a move into India in April 2016, following a partnership with Pune-based IndusInd Bank and expressions of interest in its services from more than 10,000 freelancers and small businesses across the country. 2018 PayPal study suggest that India’s freelancers represent around one quarter of the world’s gig workforce.   NEW DELHI (Reuters) - PayPal Holdings Inc will wind down its domestic payments business in India from April 1,2021 the company said in a statement on Friday.    The ideal customer is a small but growing SMB doing business all over the world which needs currency, compliance and business services. Payoneer is an obvious candidate to handles these needs given its global network. · Payoneer offers vendors the ability to move money with a U.S. bank account and pay suppliers, without having to deal with too many banking hurdles or red tape. · A lot of freelancers on Upwork.com use Payoneer because many of them live in countries that Upwork.com can't wire money to. · Once vendors receive funds into their Payoneer account they can either withdraw the cash using their Payoneer provided Master Card or do a direct bank transfer from Payoneer to their local bank. Usually funds arrive within 1-2 business days.   So, it is basically a bank that includes an accountant to help meet a business’ needs. The one product or feature that is missing is digital coins. Say a consumer wants to rent an airbnb. They use a credit card (or other payment method) to pay airbnb, a payment gateway facilitates payment acceptance. The payment is then processed and Airbnb ends up with the money from the transaction. Airbnb has now gathered cash through its acquirers (e.g., Adyen, ACI). Airbnb now needs to distribute funds to its SMB sellers. Airbnb uses payoneer to disburse funds to sellers. From this example, you can see Payoneer isn't competing with companies like Adyen or other acquirers/ processors, even though they are processing payments. Payoneer signs up individual sellers, which allows the sellers to use payoneer across platforms (e.g., facebook marketplace and amazon). Hyperwallet (owned by PayPal) is one of their competitors, but Hyperwallet operates completely differently, they sign up users via the platform, but this means you can't use hyperwallet for your business on both amazon and fb marketplace without going through the onboarding process again. Given the trend towards SMB sellers operating across multiple marketplaces, this is a huge benefit for payoneer, and makes PayPal's offering a lot less competitive. It also means Payoneer owns the seller relationship in a way that PayPal doesn't do as effectively, and makes it easier for them to package other offerings (e.g., working capital). These other offerings provide a two-fold benefit - their customer relationships become stronger, so revenue is seen as more recurring and investors will pay a higher multiple; and they'll make more money per customer. My view is that Payoneer should see an S-type growth curve, where they'll hit a critical mass of users and see exponential growth, like cashapp, or venmo. Their investor presentation projects 25% revenue growth over the next couple years, I think this is super conservative, especially considering that 25% growth rate doesn't account for the two travel related marketplaces that got screwed by covid. Once they hit that critical mass of users, they'll pop off, sales & marketing expenses will drop, and they'll become profitable.   The company’s focus on investing for future services is actually what gets me most excited as it may ward off near-term investor interest and improves its competitive position. It’s also a sign of a mature management team. The opportunity to provide additional services such as working capital, compliance and tax services seems like an obvious strategic move to drive growth. Specifically, working capital is far and away the most important service and something SMBs are desperate for.   Who are their customers and where are they know? 5 million businesses in 190 countries. Customers include Amazon, Wish, Lazada (owned by Alibaba) Shopee, and Ebay. Weird right, they work with Ebay given Paypal does too. This is because they work with countries and specific clients that Paypal not accept into their platform. Investors need to understand that sometimes people have to use other platforms because they the Paypal’s or banks are NOT willing to take the risk. Sure the risk is probably higher but the amount of people that need access to capital or payment process is high when many banks in many countries do not approve people for such type of access.   B2B global marketplace. The attractiveness of FinTech can be summarized in a few words, namely, “scale” and “network effects”. From the metrics Payoneer shared, it looks like they’re benefitting from these dynamics. Analysts estimate the global B2B market at tens of trillions $ and cross-border payments at $300bn. Obviously the pandemic only accelerated these trends. (From the presentation, it looks like company B2B AR/AP volume more than doubled at 140% in 2020 although the CFO later cited a 53% increase in volumes so not sure exactly how to interpret that.) Volume and customer growth drives revenues. Volumes grew over 53% in 2020 (67% adjusted for the pandemic) and are expected to grow at 44% and 33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, which translates into 25% annual revenue growth per year for the next two years.   The benefits of network effects cannot be overstated as Paypal has proven. As a company acquires more customers, the value of its network increases. Payoneer’s business model leverages this same dynamic. Moreover, its network would be very difficult to replicate. The company’s global platform includes over 80 banks and clearing partners in over 100 countries. The company also provides customers data about its transactions, which I believe will be increasingly useful and sticky.   What do I think the future holds for Payoneer? I actually think there are several exits for this company.  Note that Payoneer currently doesn’t do B2C, hence it may be quite common for retail to never even have heard of it, unless they are a business or in the gig economy. That is one of the problems for the stock, no one has heard of it (yet) because it works quietly behind the scenes. Given enough funding, who knows, Payoneer may well expand to B2C. Alibaba initially started as B2B as well but has since expanded to B2C (Taobao). We just need Payoneer to be 5% of PayPal (ie. $15B market cap) in order for stock price to be in the $30-$40 range. ($6B market cap corresponds to around $13-$15 stock price.)   **Acquisition:**Large international payments processer buys them. Could be Paypal, Square, Stripe, First Data, etc. consolidation WILL happen in this space and I think short-term Payoneer will acquire some companies and then be sold to a bigger company. Think of this as how banks in the USA were allowed to merge in 1995 given the law that passed.

The technologies developed by SNAP over the years have been game changer in almost all aspects and have been shamelessly copied by the major social media players. Snapchat launched the filters, stories, spotlight, in app games, social maps and many more paving the way for Snapchat being arguably the most preferred social media in the 13-24 year (90%) and 13-34 year (75%) population. SNAP has also been well received by the product companies. Their AR (Augmented Reality) technology is far superior than any of the competition that is around. The AR helps the users to try the products (apparel and accessories) and gives them more confidence about product fit and quality. This also reduces returns to a great extent and is preferred by the manufacturers.  Apple’s new privacy feature that allows the user to turn off tracking has affected the targeted advertising. This has increased the cost of acquiring sale through ads in Snap and all other mobile based advertising platforms. This move has adversely affected the earnings of SNAP and it missed their own lower end of the guidance in Q3 by $3 Mn. In the words of the CEO/Founder, Evan Spiegel, “While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS”.  But the important part here is what Evan Spiegel later said during the Q&A of the earning’s call, “This has definitely been a frustrating setback for us, but I think over the long term these privacy changes and protecting privacy for users is really important for the long-term health of the ecosystem and something that we fully support”. In the current environment it is really meaningful of a CEO to recognize this and find a way to monetize with these limitations. Also, when the supply chain issues start to resolve, maybe post the holiday period, advertisement revenue will pick up once again, mainly in SNAP (among social media); why? because of SNAP’s incredible AR technology, its metaverse model and the user group that values its privacy and which fully utilizes the AR world. Recent brands that have started using SNAP’s AR technology to target user groups include Samsung (for their wearable), Hollister, American Eagle, Ralph Lauren, HBO Max (through co-watching experience).

This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks.  MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J.

While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.    Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.

This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards  Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released,  “The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores,  “ I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory.

Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well.   Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD  “Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions. “Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”  For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‘mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases’). Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of “potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.” Micron believes that “secular growth drivers” such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND.   Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on. “In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a “high level of capital return flexibility,” which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for “competitive reasons,” it will also provide a “safety buffer” for more R&D or CapEx spending.” Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I’ll add more recent figures in the following section).

This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks.  MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the   Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron’s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.    Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.

This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards  Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released,  “The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores,  “ I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron  I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world’s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU’s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use     This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU’s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well.   Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD  “Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions. “Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”  For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November.

Also the new Star Wars Starcruiser looks super cool and probably will attract lots of people who can’t afford the vacation but go anyways. If this isn’t bullish I don’t know what is. Also Disney+ subscribers are up and continuing an uptrend way ahead of schedule, in spite of post pandemic slowdown. New shows and movies came just after earnings including Entrelazados, Shang-Chi, the muppets and many nice shorts. But the best is yet to come with Hawkeye, The Beatle, Home Alone and of course, the Spidey movie, which will be a banger. Disney also owns Spidey merch which will blow up on Christmas. Hulu is also up in subscribers by some millions and new series are coming and have banged like Only Murders in the Building. fuck Hulu though. ESPN and sports The mens NBA season is up (cause WNBA is irrelevant) and this is a constant winner for ESPN, with ratings soaring from last season’s and December being one of the months with the most viewership for basketball. Last year Christmas saw the highest number of viewers since 2012 and the uptrend is present at the start of this season. December 19 will see the G League winter Showcase and the Showcase Cup and December 27 will see the start of the regular season, with many sports journalists already calling out the rebound of TV viewership for the NBA, this is a great catalyst for Disney. Another big catalyst comes next week, with NFL and thanksgiving coming up. The NFL is also seeing a rebound in viewership, up 9% from last year, and the thanksgiving event may attract investors as ESPN will be making a lot of cash from this date only. The online platform ESPN+ is also growing exponentially with 75% increase in subscribers year over year. Though some analysts do see ESPN as a liability for Disney, the sheer presence of the company in the sports platforms and current and future incentives may make it so cross platform growth is accelerated among all three Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. I’m sure there’s other sports stuff going on and news that will further grow Disney”s dominance in the sector but I don’t usually play with balls and sports are BORING hence why this section was BORING.

Lastly, the real catalyst: The Meta Everyone should’ve heard of these little JPEGs making millions, the new form of art, zoomers’ salary magnets. Non Familiar Toddlers (can’t say it cause I get cockblocked but read the initials). Disney and many other companies have embraced the concept of virtual art. Disney released its first official Disney collection on November 6th.  Of course they sold out. According to my estimations, in the past 4 months Disney has made over $20 million in the sales of Non Familiar Toddlers, exploring this sector with Marvel first and now with other Disney and Pixar characters. The number is closer to $22 million if we count virtual unique comic sales. Disney made $7 million just last week when their “Golden Moments” collection debuted on Veve. Not only this, but they will be making recurring 6% in licensing fees each time the Non Familiar Toddler is sold. As you can expect there are already sales worth $10K, of which Disney will earn $600 each, on an open market where there are more than 100 thousand Non Familiar Toddlers just in this last collection. In total Disney published over 585 thousand Non Familiar Toddlers which are constantly sold in the secondary market and Disney gets a portion of each sale. Before November, Disney had only published collections from their Marvel products. This Golden Moments collection is just a glance of some Disney figures. This is, undoubtedly, one of the companies largest roster of individual, recognizable, influential characters. With their ownership of many major franchises and characters which are pop culture icons, this is a billion dollar opportunity that the company will be exploding in the coming months, and investors will start to notice. Finally, with Meta and their Metaverse proposal, we have seen companies as $RBLX run over 30 points for just saying they’ll be involved in a meaningful way. It is just a matter of time for Disney to announce their participation in this new technology as well. With concepts from Virtual Parks to Virtual Sports arenas, Gaming, Apparel… you get what I am saying. It is literally imposible for this company not to be involved in a major way. Short TA I was going to make TA as well but the post is very long already. just know seasonally the stock moves very well on these months, has a gap to fill ending at 173 and it’s sitting close to support at 155.58 after a small reversal yesterday. RSI on the daily says it is oversold at a tad lower than 30. The fast stoch is at 10. Literally screaming please buy me Sempai I’ll make those tendies! The End Endgame is near fellow companions, Disney is low right now but for how long will it be? Most news sources are focused on the new Spider-Man movie or the new Star Wars hotel. There is more. Disney stock will enter parabolic territory after the news of Non Familiar Toddler sales catch on. Moreover sports are being relevant again and streaming services are pumping new shows and getting new customers at a very fast pace. Massive FOMO from both public and hedge funds when they see how much Disney can make with just images online. Fucking tendies for everyone after that.

Not financial advice or whatever.","I saw a rat in my wet dreams (DIS) Fellow companions, after my successful history of not that interesting, not that rewarding, not that safe, not that reliable trades, I’ve come to you with a new one. This is a sleeping beast, one which will take us to the promised land, or hard rip our buttholes like my wife when she went through her midlife crisis at 20. This is it. I’m talking about the rat we’ve all seen in our wet dreams when they do not take place inside Chuck E. Cheese. I’m taking about Mickey. And it’s time for Disney to revisit the moon. The DD As you may know, Disney shat its pants last earnings. The mouse and its bag holders, got satan’s dongus down their throats. Disney stock is sitting at the 150s and it has developed into an opportunity for all of us who saw the bad earnings coming to get into the Rocket. Disney has existed for a while now and, though many of us have mixed feelings about the company, money and Disney have come to be synonymous. The company has acquired brands as ESPN, Star Wars, Marvel, and many other names which are recognized all across the globe. This is to Disney’s advantage as it has many catalysts coming before next year to explode. The Streaming side, Disney+, Hulu and Spidey Guess what? There’s a new Star Wars series coming out. Star Wars fans love to jack off to new lore and as a Disney investor, we’re here for it. Remember baby Yoda?

I’ve taken 90mg of Adderall, and a double strength coffee (with more on the way). Let’s get this DD started. I’m going to make this DD a little more concise and approachable than my initial deep-dive DD. Again I would recommend Eurobeat music to help you power through this DD in the right mood:                    So first, we are going to look at the past three days of trading. The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.    (    This is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).   MU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Monday’s rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.     One bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC ‘Trading Nation: “On CNBC’s ""Trading Nation,"" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.” However my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.         Micron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. The primary reason for this was that   Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.         MU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today. Update: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M). Current price (10:27AM EST) is 86.15 representing a  0.85% change.  Approx 8:40AM EST  An analysis of the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 news  “   It is noteworthy that Samsung was the first to announce LPDDR5X DRAM, however Micron was the first to validate it’s LDPDDR5X module DRAM in partnership with MediaTek.  Micron has also revealed that samples of this new memory module for smartphones supports data rates of up to 8.533 Gbps, making it 30% faster than LPDDR5 modules (it is worth noting these are the highest achievable figures for the standard, and not real world figures).   This RAM is the newest standard in RAM technology for mobile devices. It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.       MU’s current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. I’m sourcing from the below linked article for this section.   Last year delivered a 117% gain to the company’s bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.  Micron’s P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. It’s superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. The risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility.   Hyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. Major smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models.  However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM’s are showing signs of decline. “‘On the whole, the industry’s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.”*    The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components.  I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron’s business though.

They are predominantly focusing on cybersecurity and have a huge proportion of the EV manufacturers using their systems (23 of the top 25 electric vehicle automakers to be precise). The system I’m referring to is called QNX and it’s pretty impressive. I won’t bore you and write up about it so if you want to find out more, go onto BlackBerrys website/google it for yourself. Now, I’m on WSB for a reason, I’m partially retarded so I’ll keep this as short and sweet for the sake of everyone including myself. The global electric vehicle market was valued at $162.34 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $802.81 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 22.6%. Blackberry already have an advantage in the EV space and they continue to build on this every year. The opportunity for growth is significant in my opinion. SE Labs has rated BlackBerry as the best new endpoint security offering of 2021. (This was only announced yesterday). Here’s a bit about SE Labs for those of you that don’t know… “SE Labs prides itself on providing the most realistic and honest cybersecurity testing. The organization hires innovative researchers to replicate the most accurate ‘real world’ testing scenarios possible. As workplaces open and hybrid work brings with it a range of new attack vectors, it’s even more critical that security software be tested against these evolving threats.” And here’s what the CEO of SE Labs, Simon Edwards, had to say about Blackberry… “2021 has been the first year we have tested this product with BlackBerry publicly. When judging for our annual awards it is hard to ignore when a new, significant vendor enters our tests and performs so well from the start”. “Blackberry has demonstrated excellent performance in our ‘real-world’ testing, and the product is well regarded by both our expert panel of judges and users of the product.” Take this as you please, I’m no financial advisor but for those of you constantly writing off Blackberry and saying it’s a hype stock, I think you need to re evaluate and realise why people are genuinely excited about this stock. Both short term and long term potential in this stock IMO. If you made it this far, thanks for reading you beautiful bitch.

2021-11-24 16:38:06.421224,GOOGL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/EVN23,Technical analysis breakdown question (how to divide 1000 hours of analysis on specific company),"I've come across multiple respected traders throughout my research that advocate spending 1000 hours on researching companies before they make a decision.

I’ve taken 90mg of Adderall, and a double strength coffee (with more on the way). Let’s get this DD started. I’m going to make this DD a little more concise and approachable than my initial deep-dive DD. Again I would recommend Eurobeat music to help you power through this DD in the right mood:                    So first, we are going to look at the past three days of trading. The stock has had solid momentum over the last 30 days, and especially the past three days. Micron shares have gained 27% this month, the last 30 days have brought the annual gain to 34%.    (    This is also due to the Citi upgrade (see Monday section).   MU popped again on Monday, with shares rising as much as 5.6%. Monday’s rise was due to a variety of reasons, outlined below.     One bearish thing to note (not in the article), from CNBC ‘Trading Nation: “On CNBC’s ""Trading Nation,"" Michael Binger of Gradient Investments said semiconductor stocks that have gained sharply in the recent period are likely to pull back.” However my opinion as of Wednesday is that this has happened to much of the semi-sector Monday/Tuesday, but MU has remained largely unaffected thus far.         Micron again showed strong performance yesterday. Again, much of the semi sector was sliding/underperforming, yet Micron remained strong. The primary reason for this was that   Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh again became bullish on Micron. He upgraded it to buy, after downgrading it to neutral on October 20th. He changed his price target to $95 from $75.         MU is currently declining pre-market. Opening at 85.59, with a high (so far) of $86, and a (current) low of 84.62, where it is at right now as I write this segment (13:22PM GMT/08:22 EST/07:23 CST). There is no negative news, so I expect this is due to the current slide of the semi-segment and general market slightly affecting MU (whereas the past two days it has almost-always remained green despite the current market). However it is only down 0.90%, we will see what happens at open. I will update this segment then. I will also include any news that comes out today. Update: MU is still remaining strong. As of 10:25AM EST, it has so far peaked at 86.72, after opening at 84.65, the current low being 84.65 also. Volume so far is 6.81(M). Current price (10:27AM EST) is 86.15 representing a  0.85% change.  Approx 8:40AM EST  An analysis of the MediaTek Dimensity 9000 news  “   It is noteworthy that Samsung was the first to announce LPDDR5X DRAM, however Micron was the first to validate it’s LDPDDR5X module DRAM in partnership with MediaTek.  Micron has also revealed that samples of this new memory module for smartphones supports data rates of up to 8.533 Gbps, making it 30% faster than LPDDR5 modules (it is worth noting these are the highest achievable figures for the standard, and not real world figures).   This RAM is the newest standard in RAM technology for mobile devices. It aims to improve the data transfer on RAM chips used in mobile devices such as the DImensity 9000 (or other counterparts such as Samsung Exynos and Qualcomm Snapdragon). It is claimed that these Micron DRAM modules (produced with 1-alpha technology) consume the lowest power among mobile DRAMs.       MU’s current P/E ratio (as of Wednesday 24th November pre-market) is 16.3x. The median P/E ratio for the US is 18x. I’m sourcing from the below linked article for this section.   Last year delivered a 117% gain to the company’s bottom line. The EPS has fallen 57% in total from three years ago. Therefore the recent earnings growth may have been undesirable for the company.  Micron’s P/E is now in line with other companies. You can use P/E to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations. It’s superior earnings outlook is not contributing to P/E as much as expected. When strong earnings outlook is seen with faster-than-market growth, potential risks are what may be placing pressure on the P/E ratio. The risk of price drop looks to be subdued, but investors likely thing future earnings could see some volatility.   Hyperscaler and enterprise clients are continuing procurement in line with Q2, this is in order to deploy products based on new processor platforms. Major smartphone brands are expected to expand their procurement activities during Q3, as they are preparing to release new flagship models.  However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM’s are showing signs of decline. “‘On the whole, the industry’s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.”*    The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components.  I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron’s business though.

He became available after Western Digital acquired SanDisk in 2016.    “Shares rose sharply thanks to a    Because memory chips are commodity products, MU stock is prone to sharp rises and falls. Until recently (as of March 2020) it was said to be riding a “supercycle,” with chip-based memory replacing spinning disks in devices, PCs and the cloud.’  Analysts may warn that this ‘super-cycle’ is peaking, however it is just   The current supercycle is expected to run  Mehrotra sees it continuing.

However, suppliers note that orders from PC OEM’s are showing signs of decline. “‘On the whole, the industry’s quarterly total NAND Flash bit shipment increased by nearly 11% QoQ for 3Q21, and the overall NAND Flash ASP rose by nearly 4% QoQ for the same quarter. Thanks to rising prices and expanding shipments, the quarterly total NAND Flash revenue increased by 15% QoQ to a new record high of USD 18.8 billion in 3Q21.”*    The impact of the component supply shortage has increased across numerous segments of the NAND flash market, as the capacity issues in the foundry market remains unresolved. Currently, NAND Flash components are in higher available supply compared to other kinds of key components.  I would note that this is actually possibly negative news for MU, but will only affect Q4 and perhaps after that. NAND is only a segment of Micron’s business though.

This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks.  MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J.

While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.    Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.

This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards  Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released,  “The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores,  “ I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron  I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world’s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU’s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use     This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU’s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well.   Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD  “Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions. “Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”  For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‘mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases’). Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of “potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.” Micron believes that “secular growth drivers” such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND.   Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on. “In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a “high level of capital return flexibility,” which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for “competitive reasons,” it will also provide a “safety buffer” for more R&D or CapEx spending.” Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I’ll add more recent figures in the following section).    I will be heavily sourcing from  ‘On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron’s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride.

It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.’ This fall is due to Micron’s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‘When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.’ The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. ‘Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions.

It said, “The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.” Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‘Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, “Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.”’ ‘The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips.

Look out for a mini-dip on Monday or sometime next week. Enter there. Consider using DCA to get a better average cost over multiple dips.  I think this DD speaks for itself. Micron has great drivers/catalysts to drive the price upwards. It is investing heavily in itself. Nvidia is dependent on them. I am very bullish on MU after doing this research. I will try to open a position of LEAPS and shares as soon as I have the funds.    Part 2: "

2021-11-18 16:39:08.095116,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/kenzene,Industry incumbents influence on the social media community and stock price movement for the leaders in the industry,"I recently started investing in the market and started observing certain trends that are prevalent in the market. What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the brand names in the industry and the investor community for that industry in the market. For example, Apple, it has a strong following in the social media channels and usually positive sentiments on the social media channels about the stock results in a price increase. Today's chart -  Sentiment increase --> Price Increase What you would notice in this chart is that at around 9 AM today the bullish sentiments for APPL started growing on the social channel and this was followed by a price increase a couple of hours later. I also noticed the news about them accelerating their autonomous car, so that contributed to the social chatter on these channels as well. I saw this trend usually in industries where there are established brand names, such as Automotive (TSLA, RIVN), Entertainment (AMC, GME) and Tech. Media (MSFT, FB etc.) But at the same time, industries such as Marijuana, Psychedelics etc. do not really follow this trend. As I try to understand why? one reason that I could think of is that these industries do not have a strong established incumbent and hence do not really have a strong social following. Which further leads me to think that these industries are just scratching the surface of their potential market cap. Another reason that comes to mind is the percentage of the shares that are held by institutions vs individuals. So, for companies and industries where we do not see a price movement following an uptick on social media, would it be safe to assume that most investors are institutions and not individuals. How do you all perceive the social media sentiments and their relation to the stock market for growing industry vs an establish industry? Sorry if the conclusions that I have drawn are very basic and not thorough, but I would appreciate a perspective or some direction to learn more.","Industry incumbents influence on the social media community and stock price movement for the leaders in the industry I recently started investing in the market and started observing certain trends that are prevalent in the market.

Tables of stocks found below.  My diamond hands are so rough on my fleshy...forearms. I can't type anymore. Observations/Assumptions Before  you jump down my throat, these are simplified observations/assumptions,  not internationally agreed upon mandates from heaven. Okay, now you can  jump down my throat.  Hypothesis Using  industry benchmarking against the best of the best of the best  companies in each industry in order to purchase only the best companies  in equal measure should provide a well-diversified portfolio that over  the long term should be able to beat the S&P 500. Experiment 2020 750  largest US stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry  (Industry details available further down the post). Stocks were given a  score based on their relative percentage compared to the industry index.  For example, each companies’ average ROE of the last 4 years was  compared to this index value with the following type of breakdown:  For  example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was  10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,  they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would  receive a moderate rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a  great rating. This was done for all of the metrics below:  The  relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there  was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth  only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be  decreased to 125% for a better distribution. Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.  ROE Example ROE Example That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated. This  left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the  company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently  in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them  being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire? Has  WSB said it's a buy? Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason  that I want to exclude them? That left 26 across 7 sectors.  Industries 2020 Experiment Breakdown  These  26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and  September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total  purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.   Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes. Experiment 2021 2,850  tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.  The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:  More  metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to  determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to  median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of  the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example: ·  3 stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over  the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is  then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark. Each  stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the  metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite  score out of 27, from 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the  metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the  average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same  methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,  Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the  particular metric to find a useful distribution. I  also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst TICKER THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED (evidently a stock that cannot be named because I was banned the first time I posted this) with a score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9 categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn’t match the original  input (congratulations on your reading comprehension), this is primarily  due to mergers/acquisitions or the stock being taken private. Another  stock was acquired during the analysis, changing the max number yet  again.

I looked at  the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock  that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a  high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed. Next,  I read the description of ~300 stocks and looked through their  financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off  their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly  leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that  Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns  Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them (how could you not?), no  there are not great synergies between the sectors of the business, yes,  they are aware of this. I also eliminated industries I wasn’t interested  in reviewing, such as REITS due to the need to look at different  metrics like FFO, Oil and Gas because it’s oil and gas, etc. These  activities eliminated ~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I’d  need to build a separate model. I  then looked at each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made  the cut. Are all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are  the profit margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt  situation, did WSB say it's a buy, etc. Who deserves to be on this list?  This eliminated ~75. We were down  to 84 stocks at this point. I then looked at each company's investor  presentation, annual report, etc. to better understand what the company  does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was not nearly as thorough on  this portion this year compared to last year just due to the substantial  increase in companies, 26 vs 84.

A real retard.  in SEK, 1 USD equals ~8,8 SEK  I've removed the positions and just show the summary but all in all, I'm down $83,5K YTD on options and up $440K on stocks (using margin have had an impact on my stocks). GOEV Calls 6 months out, TEAMS Calls 3 months out and QQQ Puts 6 months out was my most retarded option play where I lost around $240K in total. GME weeklies, DOCN Leaps, MSFT leaps, and Hubspot leaps were my best play where I gained around $130K in total, I'm also a retard for not checking this earlier. It's a slap in the face and I'm contemplating whether I should give it up completely and just go stocks in the future."

2021-11-09 16:39:15.819589,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/NeedCookies8,"Nov 4th, Schwab Market Data Massive Lag. I should really switch to Fidelity.","So I've been a Charles Schwab user since August of last year, 2020. I've been really thinking about moving to Fidelity for the last few months. I don't know why I don't just move my accounts to Fidelity. Schwab has a good platform (could be better), is a bank, the color blue lol but not a reason, Schwab gives me leniency with trading for the $25k rule and more, and good customer service but so does Fidelity I've heard. Schwab just feels easy and comfortable because I've basically been using them since I've been investing. Throughout this year I've been considering moving to Fidelity because there have been some small things that have happened with StreetSmart Edge and just trading with Schwab in general. I do day trade and also do long-term investing. There have been times where it has taken 10 seconds to a few minutes for my cost basis/ cost per share to pop up on the screen and I have lost out on money and lost money because of this before. I'd put up with it about 6-8 months ago when that happened and hasn't happened since. It happened a few times. I haven't run into that problems since then, mainly because I haven't been placing trades as often as I used to. Something happened last week though with Schwab's desktop trading app and updating market data. Last week though... this is really what has gotten to me and honestly, when this happened I was really pissed and shocked at what was going. I sort of had no idea what to think. I called customer service after this happened, and they took down what I had to say and looked into it with the tech division or whatever division that handles market matching data. They didn't call me back after I asked them to, it was fixed a few minutes later and didn't happen again. I took a couple of screenshots of my trading screen of SSE alongside by side with Fidelity's Active Trader Pro Trading app. I saved another screenshot along with this one, but deleted the other picture (thankfully I saved at least one screenshot I took) because at the time I was going to post here on Reddit about it, but decided not to at the time because 1) I didn't have time, 2) I thought it would be taken care of (which it was), 3) it was fixed so thought it wasn't an issue anymore and it remains not an issue, and 4) because I was lazy that day/ last week and deferred writing this post until tonight. Since the 4th of November last week I have forgotten about it a little, but has been in the back of my mind since, so I am writing this now. Maybe this was just a small issue/ glitch in the system at the moment and isn't how Schwab runs things on their servers. Possibly this is a stupid post, but I don't think so. So onto it.. Last week on November 4th, I had Fidelity's Active Trader Pro and Schwab's SSE programs up to look at the market data because I've noticed all the time that Schwab doesn't print the time and sales for all transactions while Fidelity does. Schwab updates the current bids and asks that are at the top of the ask/ bid table along with the other bids and asks (that match with Fidelity, other than Schwab that does lump together orders for the same price mostly), but then doesn't print all of the sales in premarket and I'm sure for the market times as well. I have direct trading and level 2 data. Sometimes during market hours, I notice this. Maybe I don't have all of the exchanges listed for the printing of sales or something. There will be transactions that Schwab doesn't print that Fidelity prints. So, when I want to sell something I am thinking of the wrong price to sell it at because I am seeing a sell at a certain price and thinking, oh I'll set my limit to this price, even though Schwab is listing the current bid and ask, but the time and sales aren't being listed. So I set my limit to a price near the bid of the last price usually and also look at the bid and it fills and I wonder why my sell is a higher price than what I am seeing for the last time and sales, same with buying. This is because Schwab doesn't list all of the time and sales, so I am not getting all of the current market data to put orders in. I'm sure the sales of my orders go for what the market is going for at the best price since I cannot see all the time and sales on Schwab, and Fidelity shows the price I can see that it's the best price at the time of my order fill. Okay... back to what I am here to write about. Nov 4th, around 10:15ish AM EST to about 10:19-20ish AM EST, I was looking at Microsoft, MSFT, and Apple, APPL, between SSE and Active Trader Pro. Schwab was showing prices were selling for between $0-2 lower and higher depending on if the candle was green or red, compared to Fidelity. I was timing Fidelity's and Schwab's price action and Schwab was about 20 seconds or so behind in updating what Fidelity was showing, if not more. I manually timed the change in price to Fidelity and that's where I get 20 seconds. This all was happening fast so it was hard to document. I should have screen recorded, but I didn't think of that at the time. In the picture below it shows Fidelity keeping up with the time and sales of the current time and Schwab is 12 minutes behind on the time and sales, but Schwab is only 12 minutes behind on the time part. Schwab was still over a $1 difference than what Fidelity was showing, and this was between $0-$2 difference, the difference fluctuated throughout this 4-5 minute window I was looking at MSFT and AAPL. I only show MSFT here because I only took a screenshot of MSFT. I was looking on the Schwab mobile app, Fidelity's mobile app, and as well as the prices on the internet, Fidelity was showing the right prices. Through these 4-5 minutes, the real price did change $0-2 on Fidelity because of well trading, which was the real price in my eyes. Schwab was behind on the prices.. when AAPL or MSFT was showing green on Fidelity $0-2 change from the opening candle, Schwab was showing red and $0-2 change from its opening candle. Then the opposite was for a red candle on Fidelity.. Schwab was showing a green candle and $0-2 change. It was more towards $1.50 change, there was $2 difference I could see, but not a lot of trades during this time so roughly $1-1.50 was noticeable, but there were trades $2 apart I saw. Schwab's software seems to not be the greatest, or at least just a massive lag during this time. I wish I just recorded my screen because it would have been much better to express what was going on. I loaded up the ""Snipping Tool"" and chose a ""2 second time delay"" for the snipping tool to freeze the screen so I could refresh all of the time and sales window total history for Fidelity before the screen froze. Fidelity's time and sale tape are also visible, I just thought it would be good to have the time and total history sales up as well. As you can see in the photo below on the right is StreetSmart Edge and on the left is Active Trader Pro. The current time was 9:18 AM CST time for me, so 10:18 AM EST trading time. Schwab is displaying time and sales at 10:06 AM EST while Fidelity is showing 10:18 AM EST which was the current time. Fidelity shows MSFT at the last trade price of roughly $335.22, while Schwab is showing a price of $334.055, while the bid was at $334.04 and ask at $334.06 for Schwab. Fidelity was also showing a bid and ask price around what the real price was going for which was roughly $335.22 at the time. I whited out too much info for the Fidelity side by accident because my account number was showing and I was planning on keeping extra copies of my screenshot but that didn't happen, so this is the only copy I have that I whited out. You cannot see Fidelity's bid/ask prices here, as well as the last traded price of the time and sale tape, but you can see the last traded price above for the total history. Looks like there was an update to the sales when I refreshed the history sales and the time and sales tape, or the total history was faster than the tape. I assure you the bid and ask for Fidelity was around the last traded price of MSFT which was $335.22. Either way, the price for Fidelity is more right and Schwab was Drastically behind. Even though Schwab had the wrong time on their time and sales by 12 minutes the chart was showing being updated to the right time frame, but the prices were off. In this instance, the price difference was $335.22-$334.055 = $1.165. The price was off by more at other times, but for this screenshot, it was $1.165. I wish I recorded the screen because it would have shown all of the information and would have been better to see what was going on I can tell you that for sure! Fidelity Green or Red by $0-2 and Schwab the opposite by $0-2. I told this information to a Schwab Broker and the problem was fixed after about 10:20 AM EST, but still, this isn't cool. I compared SSE's information with AAPL and MSFT with Fidelity's platform and all was good I believe after 10:20 AM EST. I still checked throughout the day between the two platforms just to make sure, and everything did line up after 10:20 AM EST. Although minutes don't matter in terms of weeks or month-long trading or holding long term if you're day trading or short term trading this matters. I shouldn't be day trading or short-term trading, but I am to make money, and because I want to. This isn't what I want to be seeing from my broker. I should switch to Fidelity after having to experience this. I have used Schwab for my brokerage, Roth IRA, and checking accounts, but maybe it's time for a change. Schwab does have a great platform but it could use updating. I am sure that'll happen when they merge TDA's platform with SSE.   TL:DR: On November 4th, from roughly 10:15 AM to 10:20 AM EST I was comparing Schwab's bid & ask and time & sales to Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform. I compared AAPL and MSFT information, I only took a screenshot of MSFT. Schwab was showing different data in terms of pricing by shown here at $1.165 difference. I was seeing a difference in about $0-2 in sales pricing. I have only one screenshot. I whited out some info but whited out too much info here because I had other copies of my screenshots but accidentally deleted them. Schwab fixed their market prices after I called them, but still not good to be happening on their platform. It's not like this was happening on purpose, it's just something that was happening with Schwab's services. I have used Schwab for mainly all of my investment accounts, but maybe it's time to move. I do like Schwab a lot though. After this, I should probably switch.  Hopefully this isn't taken down lol. I haven't had a post on WSB before and it would be cool to not have this taken down, so people can see why Fidelity is better!","Nov 4th, Schwab Market Data Massive Lag.

Also FUCK ALL OF YOU for making me crawl out of my piss shit and cum covered troglodyte cave walls. There is one difference between me and you though IT'S MY SHIT AND PISS ON THE WALL. I DON'T FUCKING LET RANDOM PEOPLE SHIT AND PISS ON MY WALLS.

I was requested by a few users to write an $MU (Micron Technology) DD.           Latest news:  Micron climbed a lot on Friday. This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks.  MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the   Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron’s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.    Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.            Although you won’t find much correlation in the   Recently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards  Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released,  “The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores,  “ I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron  I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world’s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU’s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use     This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU’s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well.   Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD  “Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions. “Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”  For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‘mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases’). Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of “potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.” Micron believes that “secular growth drivers” such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND.   Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on. “In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a “high level of capital return flexibility,” which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for “competitive reasons,” it will also provide a “safety buffer” for more R&D or CapEx spending.” Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I’ll add more recent figures in the following section).    I will be heavily sourcing from  ‘On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron’s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.’ This fall is due to Micron’s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‘When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.’ The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. ‘Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.’ A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, “The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.” Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‘Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, “Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.”’ ‘The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.’  Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. ‘The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.’  ‘Tipranks’ Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock. The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.’ ‘A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.’      We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off. “     8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)”  ""Current Price: $83.03 Breakout price trigger: $83.80 Buy Zone (Top/Bottom Range): $81.00-$78.00 Price Target: $89.00-$90.00 (1st), $95.00-$97.20 (2nd) Estimated Duration to Target: 45-49d (1st), 60-64d (2nd) Contract of Interest: $MU 12/17/21 82.5c, $MU 1/21/22 85c Trade price as of publish date: $3.75/contract, $4.80/contract""  “MU in upward trend: 10-day moving average moved above 50-day moving average on November 09, 2021 The 10-day Moving Average for MU crossed bullishly above the 50-day moving average on November 09, 2021.

This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks.  MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the   Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron’s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.    Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.

This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards  Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released,  “The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores,  “ I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron  I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world’s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU’s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use     This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU’s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well.   Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD  “Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions. “Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”  For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‘mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases’). Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of “potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.” Micron believes that “secular growth drivers” such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND.   Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on. “In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a “high level of capital return flexibility,” which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for “competitive reasons,” it will also provide a “safety buffer” for more R&D or CapEx spending.” Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I’ll add more recent figures in the following section).    I will be heavily sourcing from  ‘On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron’s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.’ This fall is due to Micron’s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‘When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.’ The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. ‘Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.’ A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, “The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.” Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‘Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, “Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.”’ ‘The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.’  Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature. However you can take comfort in the fact that the lows/highs for the stock will generally move up. ‘The company has realized this and has purchased 15.6 million shares of its common stock for $1.2 billion during the fiscal year of 2021.’  ‘Tipranks’ Stock Forecast Tool indicates 15 out of 22 analysts have given MU a Buy rating, while six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock and just one has a Sell rating on the stock. The average Micron price target is $96.09, which indicates 24.2% upside potential.’ ‘A number of equities analysts recently commented on the company. Barclays decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $110.00 to $87.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. JPMorgan Chase & Co. decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $140.00 to $100.00 and set an ""overweight"" rating for the company in a report on Friday, September 24th. UBS Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $95.00 to $90.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Morgan Stanley restated a ""hold"" rating and set a $75.00 target price on shares of Micron Technology in a report on Wednesday, September 29th. Finally, The Goldman Sachs Group decreased their target price on Micron Technology from $104.00 to $88.00 and set a ""buy"" rating for the company in a report on Thursday, October 14th. One equities research analyst has rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned a hold rating, twenty-three have assigned a buy rating and two have assigned a strong buy rating to the company's stock. Based on data from MarketBeat.com, the stock has an average rating of ""Buy"" and an average target price of $103.31.’      We can break resistance and continue a rally to all time high next week, but I think we will most likely see a few more weeks of consolidation first so the RSI can cool off. “     8)RISK: This is the formula I use to trade: I never have more than 5 setups at the same time NEVER EVER. And the maximum % of risk I take on any setup is 3% (ONLY with a STRATEGY THAT YOU HAVE a lot of EXPERIENCE WITH). Let's understand this better, most of my setups happen on the daily chart , which means that time resolutions are between 2 weeks to 3 months. Another rule I use is that my setups must happen on uncorrelated assets example: NFLX / BTCUSD / XAUUSD / FCX / AMZN . So my worst-case scenario is losing all at the same time which means a -10% to -15%. That's more than acceptable for me. And the most probable thing is that I would be able to open 4 to 5 new setups 1 to 2 months later. That's why this type of trading style is so secure. Even in apocalyptic scenarios, you would face a manageable loss, and it will take you time to develop new setups (you avoid impulsive trading)”  ""Current Price: $83.03 Breakout price trigger: $83.80 Buy Zone (Top/Bottom Range): $81.00-$78.00 Price Target: $89.00-$90.00 (1st), $95.00-$97.20 (2nd) Estimated Duration to Target: 45-49d (1st), 60-64d (2nd) Contract of Interest: $MU 12/17/21 82.5c, $MU 1/21/22 85c Trade price as of publish date: $3.75/contract, $4.80/contract""  “MU in upward trend: 10-day moving average moved above 50-day moving average on November 09, 2021 The 10-day Moving Average for MU crossed bullishly above the 50-day moving average on November 09, 2021.

This was due to an analyst at Evercore ISI adding the memory chip maker to his list of top stock picks.  MU was up 8.4% to $83.52 during Friday afternoon trading. It was the second best performer of the day for the S&P 500 (shortly before 3PM). Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse noted that though shares of memory chip makers such as Micron have lagged behind the   Muse noted that WSt expectations for Micron’s Feb/May quarter earnings have been cut by 33%/31% respectively, since August. While there could be further downside, weakness is now priced in. He believes either Feb or May quarter will be a bottom for Micron’s earnings. Micron shares tend to outperform one or two quarters before a bottom in earnings, hence he believes the stock could begin a run soon.    Micron is a market leader in DRAM and NAND memory, with a market share of 20%/11% respectively. In 2021, DRAM revenues accounted for 72% of MU’s total revenues, and grew by 38% YoY.            Although you won’t find much correlation in the   Recently, data centres have developed into the fields of AI and Machine Learning for functions where a solution is required via rapid iterations. This works well with GPU’s. GPU’s lend themselves perfectly towards  Now remember that GPU’s are highly memory intensive. This is corroborated from the data specs of Nvidia’s newest chip, the A100 GPU just released,  “The first GPU to use Ampere will be Nvidia’s new (as of 2020) A100, built for scientific computing, cloud graphics, and data analytics. Nvidia new A100 GPU will also include 19.5 teraflops of performance, 6,912 CUDA cores,  “ I cannot find any sources (after half an hour of searching) that specify the exact manufacturer of the A100’s memory. However based on my experience, Nvidia consumer GPU’s use either Micron, Samsung or SK Hynix memory. Micron  I found that the Nvidia DGXA100 system (the world’s first AI system built on the A100 Tensor Core GPU, using 8 A100 GPU’s with up to 640GB of GPU memory), actually happens to use     This means Nvidia is dependant on Micron to deliver/manufacture their higher end GPU’s (as Micron are the only manufacturer of GDDR6X memory). Furthermore, Micron GDDR6 memory is commonly found in RTX3050, 3060, 3070 (including Ti) GPU’s. They are not the only manufacturer for this, but are frequently used, for example my RTX 3060 laptop has Micron memory, and my RTX 2070 Super has Micron memory. I use them for crapto mining, and the memory overclocks well.   Although not as dependent on Micron as Nvidia. AMD  “Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today (November 1st) announced that its high-performance 16Gb/16Gbps GDDR6 memory solution is now available with AMD Radeon™ RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on the AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture. Using Micron’s advanced 1z process technology, this latest version of GDDR6 enables up to 512GB/s system performance for demanding applications like gaming and graphics. Today’s announcement continues Micron’s rich history of innovation and collaboration with industry leaders to deliver breakthrough performance that enables the most advanced gaming solutions. “Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards were built to deliver high-performance, no-compromises gaming experiences, and the addition of Micron memory to the product line will help us meet that objective,” said Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “Micron has a strong history of developing advanced memory products, and we worked closely with their engineering team to optimize GDDR6 for RDNA 2 architecture-based graphics cards, giving our board partners more choice and flexibility to produce additional designs for gamers.”  For the past half year, Micron shares have been trending downwards, however this has changed in November. The shares trended downwards due to a difficult pricing environment for its PC memory products, and macro developments have had their part to play in the downtrend (‘mostly the supply chain issues behind a lack of non-memory components which has led to some customers cutting back on memory and storage purchases’). Micron has recently stated that over the next 10 years, it intends on spending $150 billion (combined) on Global Manufacturing and R&D. Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill believes this plan has brought questions of “potential over-capacity issues and whether a plan like this would be a large drag on free cash flow.” Micron believes that “secular growth drivers” such as 5G and AI use cases should see increasing demand for DRAM and NAND.   Gill agrees with Micron, in that continued demand for DRAM and NAND based on 5G/AI drivers is important to focus on. “In fact, Gill thinks the company will have enough free cash flow to provide it with a “high level of capital return flexibility,” which during cyclical sell-off periods, for example, could see the company repurchase shares. Additionally, should the need arise for “competitive reasons,” it will also provide a “safety buffer” for more R&D or CapEx spending.” Gill reiterated a Buy rating for MU stock with a $130 price target. 14 other analysts join Gil on the bull list, with another 6 holds and 1 sell, the stock has a moderate buy consensus rating (as of Oct 27 2021, I’ll add more recent figures in the following section).    I will be heavily sourcing from  ‘On the face of it, year-to-date, Micron’s stock price is almost at the same level. However, its stock has been on a 2021 roller-coaster ride. It opened 2021 at $77.42, and hit $95.3 in the first week of April. Since then, the stock steadily fell until it hit $67-levels in October. It spent time consolidating in October before starting to rise again.’ This fall is due to Micron’s cyclical nature of business. The stock moves based on the demand/supply for memory. ‘When the world needed semiconductors, the stock moved up. Now, as the world is slowly opening up, there was a fall in its stock price. However, Micron stock seems to have bottomed out.’ The company has beaten earnings expectations in the last four quarters (each of), the company has delivered profits and has not disappointed investors. ‘Micron Technology president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said that the demand outlook for 2022 was strong, and Micron would continue to deliver innovative solutions. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the company’s guidance is $7.65 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 46%.’ A June report by Global Market Insights states that semiconductor memory market revenue will cross $180 billion by 2027. It said, “The growing uptake of Dynamic Random-access Memory (DRAM) in gaming consoles, PC hardware, and high-performance computing devices will support the industry growth.” Micron has stated that memory and storage are a growing portion of this industry, representing approximately 30% of the semi market. The company also stated that government support would be crucial for its expansion plans, as memory manufacturing in the US costs around 35%-45% more compared to lower cost markets. ‘Funding to support new semiconductor manufacturing capacity is a must, said EVP of Global Operations Manish Bhatia. He added, “Sustained government support is essential for Micron to ensure a resilient supply chain and reinforce technology leadership for the long term.”’ ‘The top three companies in the sector invest billions of dollars every year to manufacture chips. These chips are increasingly getting more complicated and expensive with every passing generation. It is very unlikely that price wars will break out over market share. The game will be played on quality.’  Investors (regards) will have to accept that the company stock price is generally going to be volatile, due to its cyclical nature.

2021-10-25 16:40:50.287569,NFLX,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/Lost-Guarantee229,Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate,"There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of “Squid Games”. Squid Games has quickly become an international sensation after reaching 111M+ global viewers in more than 200 different countries. Squid games has brought a lot of hype to Netflix (and their original content) and has set the stage for an interesting Q3 2021 earnings report for their stock investors. Today, I am here to predict how Netflix’s Q3 earnings report will go, and a large part of this will be focusing on the growth of their platform in the past quarter due to their hit show “Squid Games”. At the end of this analysis, you will find a   Firstly, as we know, Squid Games had reached over 111M global users in over 200 countries in the past month alone. This in and of itself is impressive, however factoring in their low production cost of $21.4M makes it exponentially more impressive. Squid Games was able to keep these costs low due to filming in South Korea (Internationally) which allows for actors to work longer hours and can bring the cost of production down. Top executives have predicted that the cost to shoot domestically (in Hollywood) would have been 5-10x more than Netflix’s cost of production. This series in particular has opened the floodgates for streaming services to shoot internationally, as many of them are now starting to express interest in it. Squid Games was a huge money maker for Netflix and has been estimated to be worth in the ballpark of $900M, which represents a return on their investment (production) of over 4,100%. Considering Netflix’s revenues last quarter were $7.3B, Squid Games is likely to represent a large percentage of their revenues in Q3, and since their margins are so impressive, it is likely that we see Squid Games have a role to play in Netflix having better margins on their upcoming earnings.  The most important factor that I derived from Netflix’s Q2 2021 financial report is the fact that their weighted average subscription price across all of their regions is $12.26. This will be very important in determining the revenues in Q3 2021. Furthermore, Netflix’s revenues in Q2 2021 were $7.34B, and their cost of revenues was $4.02B (54.73% of revenues).   I am basing Netflix’s revenues off of their previous revenues, plus the new revenues that are brought in by additional subscribers in this quarter. Firstly, to get the new subscriber figures I decided to take Netflix’s estimate of 3.5M in this quarter for the first 3 months, due to squid games not being added. This resulted in 900k new subscribers per month for the first 3 months, which adds up to 2.7M new subscribers in June, July, and August. Lastly, we needed the new subscribers for the month of September. This was more difficult to calculate as they released Squid Games this month which drove in far more traffic than usual. In order to get a proxy for how many new subscribers a “hit” like Squid Games can bring in, I used the data from Netflix’s 2nd biggest show “Bridgerton.” Like Squid Games, Bridgerton was released 1 month prior to their earnings report, and helped Netflix to beat their new subscriber estimates by 41%. However, since squid games is 50% more popular than Bridgerton was in their first month, I think it is reasonable to estimate that Squid Games can help Netflix beat their Q3 2021 new subscriber estimates by 61.5%. Increasing Netflix’s Q3 subscriber figures yield 5.65M new subscribers over the whole quarter. This means that in September, Netflix likely brought in 2.95M new subscribers mostly off of the success of Squid Games. Overall, if Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers June, their revenue generated for the quarter would be $44.32M (900000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in July, their revenues generated for the quarter would be $33.1M (900,000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in August, their revenues for the quarter would be $22.07M (900,000*$12.26*2 months). Lastly, if Netflix brought in 2.95M subscribers in September as a result of Squid Games, their quarterly revenues would be $36.16M. In total, it is reasonable to assume Netflix increased their revenues by $136.22M, bringing their Q3 revenues to $7.48B. However, Netflix has been reported to have increased their prices by $1 in many regions. To be conservative, we can assume a $0.50 increase across all regions, which would result in a 4% increase on average prices. This would then cause Netflix’s quarterly revenues to be 4% higher, totalling $7.78B. This would represent earnings beat of 0.28B (or 3.7%).  As previously mentioned, Squid Games is very likely to have increased Netflix’s margins. As a result of this we can conservatively estimate that Netflix’s cost of revenues is 54% of their revenues (as opposed to 54.73% in Q2 2021). By doing this their cost of revenues should be $4.2B  Assuming that Netflix’s other costs are the same % of revenues as they were in the previous quarter, we can estimate all of these other expenses to total $1.56B.  If these assumptions are correct, then Netflix’s operating income for Q3 2021 should be $2.01B.  Assuming Netflix’s Net Income to Operating Income ratio is the same (over the past 6 months), we can estimate that Netflix’s Q3 Net Income figure to be $1.25B.  Since Netflix has 442.6M shares outstanding, their diluted EPS should be $2.74. This would represent a 7% EPS  I think that Netflix is going to narrowly beat earnings, which in theory should be good for the stock. However, since Squid Games was released, the stock has been up 6-7%. As a result, I think that NFLX will not have a big reaction from their earnings. I think that they might open the next trading day (October 20th) up between 0-1% and close the day between -0.5% and +0.5%. If I am correct, then the best way that I could think to play this via iron condors. I think that a 600/615/635/650 iron condor would be suitable given ","Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of “Squid Games”.
