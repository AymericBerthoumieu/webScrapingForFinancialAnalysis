2021-10-25 15:57:18.506487,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/Stonkgang_,How To Pick BIG MOVERS üöÄ - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.," The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average ‚ÄúAverage daily range‚Äù for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it‚Äôs shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it‚Äôs our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let‚Äôs assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip). In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive. Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).   Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it‚Äôs potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position. However it‚Äôs not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let‚Äôs take a look at two names with similar ADRs.    2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.   As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you‚Äôre a day trader with a short bias.  One of the large misconceptions with beginner traders are that penny stocks provide a better chance of large percentage/monetary gains. More often that not this couldn‚Äôt be any further from the truth. For this example we‚Äôre going to compare two speculative names to keep things fair. Both names have almost no revenue and are therefore considered as speculative plays.    Since early February 2021 this stock has been in a downtrend with any moves higher being aggressively sold into. The volume has decreased on a weekly and daily basis which tells us there‚Äôs very little attention on the name and therefore it‚Äôs very unlikely we‚Äôll see any worthwhile movement soon. There is also currently no hype in or surrounding the sector. It‚Äôs current stock price is $5.60 and has an ADR of 4.47% 2. Lithium America. Another speculation name which has received quite a lot of attention across social media and amateur traders, however there‚Äôs a huge difference. Firstly the chart isn‚Äôt trending lower but the complete opposite as it attempts to break into all time highs. Secondly the volume is increasing which shows attention to the name is increasing and therefore a big move is likely (one has recently happened, we traded it). Thirdly there is a large amount of hype in the sector with similar names also being bought and gaining attention. The current price of this stock is $25.43 and the ADR on this stock is 6.73%   So in this example we have two speculative stocks both with little to no revenue. However the Penny stock NNDM has a downtrending chart, no hype, no volume and therefore almost no chance of breaking out.Lithium America on the other hand has a very strong chart, lots of volume, increase hype and therefore a great chance of breaking out. It‚Äôs irrelevant if you have $500 to invest or $500,000 as Lithium America in this example on any given day will provide a larger move and better return than NNDM. Not to mention that the likelihood of the move happening on Lithium America is far greater due to the points outlined.  The ADR can also be used to avoid bad entries using the simple mathematics and change of probability. If you‚Äôre looking to get into a name which has had no news, no increase in volume and isn‚Äôt set to breakout then you‚Äôll want to avoid entering if it‚Äôs already close to 1 ADR. Based on averages and the law of probability it‚Äôs extremely likely that in that scenario you‚Äôll be entering at the high of the day. The opposite to this is a strong name that‚Äôs holding its trend is reaching 1 ADR to the downside. If all other factors look good then the law of probability states you‚Äôre likely buying at the low of the day. On aggressive breakouts and large catalysts such as earnings we can use the ADR to determine where we take profits or when we may avoid a late entry. It's not uncommon for large catalysts like a big earnings beat to provide 3-5 ADR's on the first day. You can therefore once again use the data to determine the probability of continuation and a good/bad entry.  We use ADR to filter out the names which have the potential to provide us with a significant move. However they must also have a clean technical chart with some form of growth and/or growth potential. The ADR is the key number to go by Ideally you want to see a minimum of 3% ADR and ideally something within the 5-10% range.","How To Pick BIG MOVERS üöÄ - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.

2021-10-25 15:57:20.337828,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/MaybeRocketScience,Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging,"Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off. Would like to share my findings and have opinions on how to play this. The hedge fund in question is  I cannot mention the company, as: - based on quick calculations, they never reached the $1.5B market cap threshold, and are hence (appropriately) qualified per WSB rules as ""worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes"". - otherwise every single person on WSB would load up on puts or do whatever shit. Anyway, if you have minimal research skills you'll guess/find what I'm talking about. I'll call it Company X for this post. Company X has no meaningful revenue, and does nothing but lose money. In the management team, there's a guy who recently settled for fraud, for his involvement in another company (which recently collapsed). The stock used to have a total market cap of ~$20M, right now, after massive dilution (5x O/S in a few months), shares are trading higher and the total market cap is ~$650M. Company X has recently engaged in a flurry of M&A, spinoffs and whatever else, creating potential ""catalysts"". It's also heavily promoted by well known Twitter personalities. Not having the cash to fund such endeavors, they started issuing convertible notes. And here Hudson Bay comes into play. The hedge fund offered hundreds of millions $ to Company X in convertible notes with short expiration (note: company revenue ~$2.5M). Other warrants have been offered to them and, to a lesser extent, to other firms. As Company X doesn't make money, but spends a decent bit, they are now asking shareholders to approve early exercise of all warrants.  Very few warrants issued Pointing out that, without that, the company would be in a tough situation (and realistically the M&A activities might be gone):  A little nudge on the vote Hudson Bay Capital would have, including the convertible note, warrants for about 120M shares, which is more than the current O/S total (~100M). Dumping such truckload of shares wouldn't be feasible, with current volumes. Hence, I suspect they are pulling of a magic financial trick called Warrant hedging I know, what the hell is this, who the fuck trades warrants, etc. Warrants are basically call options, but they're issued by the company, hence the money would go straight to them if exercised. Warrant hedging means: - you hold a warrant at $10 - you place a short at $20 - your position is hedged. No matter where the price goes, you locked in a risk free profit. It's also an unsqueezable short, since you can't get margin called. The moment such warrants are exercised, you cash out of your position with $10 in profit, the company cashes in $10 from the warrant, and shareholders are left holding the bag. There are a series of things that make me suspect such strategy is being employed. The first is that the SI has gone nowhere but up lately, despite the supposed ""squeeze"" and the subsequent tanking. It's worth noting that high SI has been recently attracting flocks of retail traders, hoping for squeeze profits. Price action would look manipulated: whenever the share price approaches the warrant level, volume dries up until there's a rebound, often ""catalyst"" triggered. Then huge volume, price goes flat/down, rinse and repeat. HBC can place a de-facto risk free short anytime the price is above the warrants (lowest is $2.655). This leads to a situation in which they could, in principle, short a ton of Company X stock, wake up on the day after the early exercise is approved, and cover their position by exercising their warrants. No messed up price action, which they'd get if they were to dump their position, just a sudden spike in O/S. There are a few instances in which this may not be the case: - HBC actually plans to dump their position after early exercise is allowed. Whatever. - HBC plans to hold >$700M, close to 10% of their portfolio, in a single low cap stock with no revenue and dubious management. This would dwarf their  - shareholders vote against the proposal. This opens up a pandora box of deals falling apart, and potential default, for Company X. Considering that, in principle, the last could happen and create some turbulence, and looking at a SI of ~20-25%, I would think HBC is employing this strategy for a decent chunk, but not all, of their holdings. Last thing to note: the company has placed another ""catalyst"" (spinoff) one week after the vote, possibly to encourage retail not to offload their shares. This was originally planned for the day after the vote, but has since been postponed. It would help the hedge fund dump the rest of the shares. The question now is:  I bought some puts, was swimming in the green, getting hammered this week. Would you think puts for the spinoff week would work? Puts for this Friday? A month from now? And especially, could the warrant hedging just balloon the O/S without any meaningful price action when exercised? In which case, my puts would be fucked? That's all, thanks for coming to my TED talk tl;dr : the Hudson Bay Capital hedge fund is pulling off some serious fuckery","Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off.

2021-10-25 15:59:07.013569,GOOGL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/sweetsweettendies,The power of holding through an uptrend,"Everyone even remotely familiar with the stock market has heard the saying ‚Äúlet your winners run and cut your losers‚Äù. Plug this catch phrase into Google and you‚Äôll find hundreds of very vague ‚Äúarticles‚Äù of how, if you are lucky to catch that winner, you must let it ride, but barely anyone presents a real strategy of how that would be done properly, leaving novice investors diamond handing their stocks all the way up and all the way down again. Isn‚Äôt that a frustrating experience? Worst part is- this experience psychologically conditions the trader to pick up bad habits. After being caught out like that, it appears that the best thing to do is to grab that small profit market is giving you and get out till the next trade. Therefore the new trader is now conditioned to take small profits from numerous trades just to get caught in some random downtrend that wipes out all of the profits taken in months. That would mess with anyone‚Äôs psychology and more bad habits would follow‚Ä¶ revenge trading, overtrading, picking risky and questionable investments, while to start with there was nothing wrong with the idea of holding your winners, it just had to become a real strategy with clear entry and exit points (more about it later) and strong reasoning of why the trade was entered to begin with. I‚Äôm going to explain why holding your winners works mathematically and can be one of the most lucrative strategies, how to pick your entries and plan exits and what type of set ups I‚Äôm personally looking for. I‚Äôm also going to outline the factors that should be considered a sign that this particular strategy should not be employed. Let me start from the mathematical aspect of this strategy. Let‚Äôs say that the trader bought 1000 shares of stock ABC, that is trading at $10. The stock is in the uptrend, moving up 2% a day for the next 10 days. Here is how daily profits on $10,000 capital would look like: Day 1 +$200       total profit $200 Day 2 +$204       total profit $404 Day 3 +$208       total profit $612 Day 4 +$212        total profit $824 Day 5 +$216        total profit $1040 Day 6 +$220        total profit $1260 Day 7 +$224        total profit $1484 Day 8 +$230        total profit $1716 Day 9 +$234        total profit $1950 Day 10 +$240      total profit $2190 As you see from the first column the trader is benefiting from the power of combined interest. The longer the trader holds the same position the more profitable each move up is, even if the stock is moving consistently by the same percentage. For example a 2% move on day 10 actually benefited the trader 2.4% from his original investment. This becomes even more noticeable as time goes on. On day 30 the mare 2% move would cash the trader $320 for the day increasing his original position by 3.2%. We have established that holding a stock through an uptrend becomes more and more profitable as time goes on. So what‚Äôs the problem? Well the problem seems to come from lack of planning and strategy and possibly conviction. Before buying any stock, I put in days worth of research, watch the stock trade for adequate amount of time to start seeing its ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù, scout public forums for other opinions and things I have possibly missed or information that other people stumbled upon. But my research doesn‚Äôt end there. Technical analysis is just as important. I go over every angle. I find my moving averages, support and resistance levels, go over daily volume and volume per price (that‚Äôs to indicate where previous bag holders will be tempted to close their positions) , find levels where the stock is likely to experience volatility explosion (usually levels with previous low volume per price) and note where short sellers will be tempted to enter. By the time I‚Äôm done with my research there is very little that can surprise me about the stock. I know all the upcoming catalysts. Would technical changes happen I would be ready to notice immediately. I ask myself questions like ‚Äúis company likely to dilute its shareholders and when did last dilution happen?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat could be possible negative events?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat would change my conviction about the stock and company completely?‚Äù. Once all of this research is done I don‚Äôt just blindly jump in. And it‚Äôs all so tempting! There are so many undervalued companies out there that fundamentally are amazing, yet charts or media sentiment are so ugly. Patience is the key. I wait for the stock to retest it‚Äôs long term support and confirm it. I start buying around that support level. Comfortably averaging in. This is not a day trade strategy, this is a swing trade strategy so I take my time to get comfortable in the position. It‚Äôs also very important not to overbet -even the strongest charts sometimes break and having extra capital can save your position in the unfortunate turn of events. But more about mitigating the risks later‚Ä¶. Once I‚Äôm comfortable in my new position I already am aware of resistance levels but I don‚Äôt blindly sell at those levels, that‚Äôs where continuous technical analysis comes in. I watch daily volume as my most important indicator and combine that information with volume per price to come up with probability of stock continuing the up trend. High enough daily volume on the green side will most likely push the stock through levels where other investors are likely to exit. Higher positive volume is also a repellent for short sellers. Biggest and the most profitable moves can happen once the stock breaks upwards of previous resistance. Not only short sellers, that were in the wrong, will be closing their positions repurchasing the shares, but new ones will not enter until they are confident that an uptrend is over. So knowing all this, where to take profits? I look for discrepancies that could possibly indicate that the chart is weakening. The key is to exit before a significant consolidation period. One of those signs is a large sell order in the order book that would be near impossible to fill with current volume. Others are: shrinking volume, lack of buy bids at lower levels in the order book, short term RSI is not resetting to oversold during fluctuations or general market condition is weakening. As long as I do not see any of these discrepancies, I believe that the position is better left alone to play out it‚Äôs full potential. Since we have established an entry and exit points I‚Äôm going to quickly overview the type of setups I‚Äôm looking for. They don‚Äôt come around often, but can yield returns of 30%-200% within weeks. Latest examples of stocks, that I have personally traded, and achieved those results are BNGO, RKT, CLOV and SPCE. I believe that in the matter of weeks I‚Äôll be able to add RIOT to that list, but the future is never certain. My main criteria while looking for this type of trade is finding companies with extreme fundamental changes, that is unnoticed or unacknowledged by the market. For medical companies it would be an important drug or equipment approval, for others -expanding contracts, expansion to new markets, or becoming profitable due to unexpected immediate growth. It also could be the loss of competition (right now it is the case of American based miners, due to China‚Äôs restrictions on miners). If the stock is undervalued without counting in the fundamental changes- it‚Äôs an added bonus!The best part about relying on fundamentals and research is -low risk for a loss. Even if the trader makes technical analysis mistake or gets stuck in an unexpected downtrend the stocks tend to come back to their fundamental value. With this strategy, having a little bit of patience, there is little reason to cut losses (contrary to a popular saying), unless of course there are major negative catalysts or new fundamental flaw. On the other hand it is wise to have extra capital, in case the trade doesn‚Äôt play out right away, and seas any opportunity to grab shares at a greater discount. Averaging down is a powerful risk mitigation tool, if used in the correct way. After establishing a comfortable position, I would not suggest to start averaging down any sooner than after experiencing at least a 20% loss, and only if fundamentals still stand (this percentage is applied to volatile mid-cap trades). Averaging down too soon takes away the trader‚Äôs edge and in most cases contributes to a greater loss initially. Once I find these stocks with huge fundamental changes I make sure to mark up all the upcoming catalysts (that‚Äôs what will kick off the trade and will allow the market to notice our company). For example earnings could be an amazing catalyst because analyst coverage comes soon after. We have overviewed our entry and exit points, type of stocks we are looking for, but what about the negative factors to watch out for?

Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that  But what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.  So in this week‚Äôs analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!     Given that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price & Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years [1]. Now we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)     Given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it‚Äôs below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY.     Based on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.    No matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high. The least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.     There are some limitations to the analysis. a. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns b. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute). c. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years‚Äô worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.     I started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames [5,10, 20 years] and various endpoints [Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns. Since this is an optimization problem, I am     Till we find our King Arthur, all of us average Joes can rest easy knowing that there is no simple trick that can give you a better return than a vanilla DCA strategy. Until next week‚Ä¶.     [1] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years. [2] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis. [3] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds [4] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends [5] The idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from JP Morgan which stated that 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones ","Why is simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing the last 3 decades of stock market data to find the best DCA strategy By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that  But what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.  So in this week‚Äôs analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!     Given that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price & Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years [1]. Now we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)     Given that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit.

2021-10-25 15:59:20.418286,GOOGL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/Lost-Guarantee229,SKLZ update and rebound potential,"*There are a couple of things that I cut out, if you want to see them there are links to my full analysis*  Hello all, It has been nearly 4 months since I first posted my analysis of $$KLZ. Since then, this investment idea has done terribly and is currently down 62%. This update post will help you to understand why this position has performed poorly over the past couple months. Furthermore, this update will provide recent news and events that can help $SKLZ to turn around, and potentially reach my target price set out in my original analysis (found   Over the past couple of months there have been a tremendous number of filings between SKLZ and the SEC, however, I have narrowed down these filings by finding/presenting you with the 3 most important filings over the past 4 months.  On August 3rd, 2021, SKLZ released their Q2 2021 earnings report, which had some points that I would like to highlight in this section. Firstly, SKLZ reported their 22nd quarter of consecutive growth, this is expected as it is a young, high-growth prospect, however their growth rate is very high. SKLZ was able to grow their revenues and profits by a factor of 52%, however they reported a greater net loss, and lower EBITDA. Overall, there is a lot of revenue growth however none of this growth is being transferred into SKLZ pockets, which is normal for a high growth stock, but is somewhat worrying. I am looking for them t turn this trend around in the next couple quarterly reports and start to decrease their net losses or else I will exit the position. Secondly, SKLZ acquired Aarki in July of 2021. Aarki is a demand-side marketing platform that has 465M active monthly users, data engines, and machine-learning algorithms that deliver high ROI to their advertising customers. This acquisition is very strategic and can help SKLZ to acquire users and monetize their platform more efficiently. This should help to drive in more revenues for both Aarki and Skillz. Additionally, SKLZ entered into a strategic partnership with ‚ÄúExit Games‚Äù, in which they agreed to purchase a $50M minority stake in Exit Games. Exit Games is a German company that allows developers to create and host real-time multiplayer games (like SKLZ). This deal gives SKLZ the access/rights they need in order to use Exit Games‚Äô technology to accelerate SKLZ‚Äôs multiplayer game growth, and for SKLZ to use in their eSports tournaments/platforms. Lastly, SKLZ announced their partnership with the NFL for NFL-branded mobile games. Currently there are 14 NFL-branded games being developed and SKLZ plans to choose just 3 of them to launch in 2022 or early 2023.  On August 16th, 2021, SKLZ submitted/completed their S-1 filing, which means that they registered more Class A common shares. In this filing, SKLZ noted that they registered 4,401,615 shares at an offering price of $11.88, which diluted previously held shares by roughly 1%. These shares were granted to SKLZ CEO (Andrew Paradise) as a result of their ‚Äú2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan‚Äù.  On September 14th, 2021, SKLZ announced that they granted (not vested) Andrew Paradise a total of 16,119,540 Performance Stock Units (PSU‚Äôs) to be earned over the next year. Each PSU can be vested for 1 Class A common stock and is a part of SKLZ‚Äôs ‚Äú2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan‚Äù. The 2021 and 2020 Incentive plans are nearly identical and follow the following framework. This plan outlines the total compensation available for Andrew if he meets certain performance thresholds. The total compensation (16.12M shares) is divided equally into 4 tranches (think of a tranche, the same way you think of slices of a pie), each containing 4,029,885 PRU‚Äôs. Each of these tranches is unlocked when Andrew (and the company (SKLZ)) meet certain performance measures. These tranches are unlocked after a SKLZ market cap reaches a certain multiple during the timeframe. The 4 performance milestones are 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x. If Andrew is able to grow SKLZ‚Äôs market cap by 4x, then he will receive 3 tranches (12.09M PRU‚Äôs). However, if the market cap multiple is a fractional number like 4.2x, then Andrew will receive 20% of the 4th tranche, which would equate to an additional 805,977 shares (above the 4x multiple). I think this is good news for shareholders as Andrew is heavily incentivized to pump the share price and keep it there for 60 consecutive days (which is part of the arrangement). It will be interesting to see what Andrew and SKLZ do over the course of the next year to achieve this, and it should be very beneficial for shareholders. This plan was also mentioned with some additional details in my original analysis found   *See this in my full analysis    On September 23rd, 2021, SKLZ announced the release of ‚ÄúBig Buck Hunters‚Äù on their gaming platform, and for their eSports tournaments. SKLZ released Big Buck Hunters: Marksman‚Äù on their platform, which is their first ever first-person-shooter (FPS) game. This is important because SKLZ‚Äôs CEO Andrew Paradise has announced his willingness to expand into FPS games, and this is their first move into doing so. This genre of gaming is wildly popular and has a dedicated and active fan base, which can translate into tremendous sales if SKLZ is able to create a breakthrough FPS game in the future. Since their release of this game on IOS, they have already ranked #3 in the App Store for ‚ÄúPopular Sports Apps‚Äù.  On August 4th, 2021, SKLZ was named one of ‚ÄúFast Company‚Äôs‚Äù 100 best workplaces for innovators. SKLZ managed to crack #37 on this list, which is pretty high, and they are joined by the likes of Google, Moderna, Samsung, and General Electric. All of the companies that made this list are said to have ‚Äúcreated and sustained cultures of innovation, even in remote work environments‚Äù. This comes just months after SKLZ was awarded ‚ÄúThe Best Place to Work‚Äù by both The San Francisco Business Times, and The Silicon Valley Business Journal. Both of these publications stated that SKLZZ is known for recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest talent‚Äù. These awards are very good for the company as it should help them to attract top talent and retain their current talent. Furthermore, people who are happy at work and are in good work environments can be more   *See this in my full analysis   In this section, I will explain factors that contributed to SKLZ‚Äôs declining share price that I mentioned in my previous analysis, as well as factors that I did not mention in the analysis that had negative effects on their share price.  SKLZ‚Äôs Q2 financial report had some upsides and some downsides. However, I found that the downsides outweighed the upsides for the following reason. SKLZ‚Äôs net loss increased by 300% YoY which is terrible, and signals that they are moving in the wrong direction. Furthermore, their Adjusted EBITDA fell by over $28M YoY, which is again not a good look. Although SKLZ has increased revenues greatly over the past year, they have not been able to convert that into a better bottom line, which is why investors are panicking and selling off their positions. I say they are moving in the wrong direction as a result of their previous earnings reports. From 2018 to 2019 SKLZ was able to decrease their net losses, which got investors excited that they were making their way towards profitability. However, over the past 2 years (2020 and TTM) SKLZ‚Äôs net loss has grown by a factor of 10x. SKLZ performance in the net loss category over the past 2 years is one of the leading financial related reasons why investors are exiting their positions.  Since I posted this analysis in June of 2021, the high rate of inflation (5.4%) has persisted over the past 4 months. These high levels of inflation are not good for hyper growth stocks like SKLZ. Furthermore, during this same timeframe the US 10-Year Yield increased from 1.489% to 1.518%, which is also not good for SKLZ. The reason that increasing yields/inflation are bad for hyper growth stocks is the fact that these rates are incorporated in the WACC, which is used to discount future cash flows. If the discount rate is higher (which is the case with a higher 10-Year Yield), than todays share value based on future cash flow would decrease as a result of todays money becoming less valuable.  *See this in my full analysis   This is one of the factors that I did not mention in my previous analysis. Earlier this year there were 2 short-seller reports that were published, claiming that SKLZ was covering up revenue losses on their top 3 games, and that they falsified their revenues. This triggered several lawsuits and hurt SKLZ‚Äôs share price. These reports came out before I posted my analysis, however they have had longer term effects on the share price and was one of the reasons why SKLZ was down so much in July. Another reason for their decrease in July can be attributed to Cathy Wood selling a somewhat large portion of her SKLZ holdings. In July Cathy sold over 1M shares which represented nearly 16% of her total holdings in SKLZ. The reason that this had such a large influence on the share price of SKLZ is because it initially gained popularity via Cathy and her conviction of the stock. However, many investors saw this sale as Cathy not believing in it anymore, which caused them to exit their position(s).  I think that SKLZ is headed in the right direction when looking at their recent partnerships, investments, and buyouts. I think that their strategies behind these moves (and their possible expansion into India) can serve their business very well, and set them up for future success, however, there are some current factors (like their dilution and financial shortcomings) that have restricted their share price from showing these successes. In terms of a valuation, I would have to use the same valuation that I achieved through my comparable analysis in my  If you appreciate the effort and want to see more content like this follow me ","SKLZ update and rebound potential *There are a couple of things that I cut out, if you want to see them there are links to my full analysis*  Hello all, It has been nearly 4 months since I first posted my analysis of $$KLZ.

If the discount rate is higher (which is the case with a higher 10-Year Yield), than todays share value based on future cash flow would decrease as a result of todays money becoming less valuable.  *See this in my full analysis   This is one of the factors that I did not mention in my previous analysis. Earlier this year there were 2 short-seller reports that were published, claiming that SKLZ was covering up revenue losses on their top 3 games, and that they falsified their revenues. This triggered several lawsuits and hurt SKLZ‚Äôs share price. These reports came out before I posted my analysis, however they have had longer term effects on the share price and was one of the reasons why SKLZ was down so much in July. Another reason for their decrease in July can be attributed to Cathy Wood selling a somewhat large portion of her SKLZ holdings. In July Cathy sold over 1M shares which represented nearly 16% of her total holdings in SKLZ. The reason that this had such a large influence on the share price of SKLZ is because it initially gained popularity via Cathy and her conviction of the stock. However, many investors saw this sale as Cathy not believing in it anymore, which caused them to exit their position(s).  I think that SKLZ is headed in the right direction when looking at their recent partnerships, investments, and buyouts. I think that their strategies behind these moves (and their possible expansion into India) can serve their business very well, and set them up for future success, however, there are some current factors (like their dilution and financial shortcomings) that have restricted their share price from showing these successes. In terms of a valuation, I would have to use the same valuation that I achieved through my comparable analysis in my  If you appreciate the effort and want to see more content like this follow me "

Xanadu uses photonic systems that are great, and run at room temp but they need lots of additional hardware to work and will be difficult to scale down. Microsoft is working on topological arrays which would provide utility benefits but it hasn't been proven yet and they had to retract one of their papers on it. The point is that there are various methods to how you can create and manipulate qubits, the foundation for quantum computing. IONq uses trapped ions, from a single atom of ytterbium. Technically a rare metal but it's not rare. Then they manipulate the ions using lasers to create the qubits on the array. Sh*t is bleeding edge and I understand .005% of it but I read everything I can find. It can run at room temp and be easily scaled. Basically IONq doesn't need all the extra resources to create and manipulate their qubits, so the cost and energy requirements are down. This also allows for upscaling arrays on existing hardware. Like they can turn a 16 qubit system into a 64 qubit system eventually using the same stuff  they just have to reduce the expected errors that come with quantum computing. IONq got starting investment money from Amazon, Alphabet, Bill Gates, Samsung, Lockheed Martin, Hyundai, goldman sachs and more.

The CEO, Peter Chapman attended MIT when he was only 16 and was the technical director for Amazon prime before he founded IONq. Remember when you see qubit numbers in the future and from other companies, what that really means. Quantum computing is based on ""physical qubits"" and ""digital"" simulated qubits. Conventional computers use bits. No matter what method you use, ions, photonic, superconducting, etc, You can't have a fully isolated qubit because then you couldn't interact with it to manipulate and tell it what to do. To get around this, modern quantum computing is based on running ""leaking"" environments with varying fidelity and trackable errors. We use the say 93% that is still functional to simulate more isolated qubits, and use those to simulate even more isolated qubits, in deeper layers until we have a fully isolated qubit we can error correct. Eventually we need 1 million qubit machines to simulate 10k error corrected machines. IONq just demonstrated how they can scale up to a million at a recent presentation.

Nokia Is an Undervalued 5G Play With Massive Upside Potential | NASDAQ Shares of telecommunications giant Nokia (NYSE:NOK are finally on the move. Its stellar earnings and quarterly guidance hike has boosted its shares significantly. Moreover, it continues to win over new clients who have solidified its position in the 5G race. NOK stock gained a healthy 16% in the past three months... NOK stock was caught in the retail trading frenzy for a short time in January, which drove its share price as high as $9.79. The stock tanked a month later to roughly $4 and was stuck at that level for a while. However, the company‚Äôs recent contract wins and remarkable earnings performance lifted the stock over its resistance levels. It still trades cheaply based on its incredible long-term outlook. Its forward price-to-sales (P/S) estimate is at just 1.3 times expected sales. Hence, NOK stock is worth investing in at current levels and has plenty of upside potential. A Guidance Hike Bodes Well for NOK Stock Nokia raised its 2021 financial guidance in July after an improved performance in the second quarter. It now forecasts its revenues to fall between 21.7 billion euros and 22.7 billion euros compared to previous guidance of 20.6 billion euros to 21.8 billion EUROS The foundation for the hike was laid by the company‚Äôs impressive second-quarter results. It posted revenues of 5.31 billion euros, which came in 4.3% higher on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, constant currency net sales rose 9% from the prior-year period. The increase was driven by robust growth across all business groups, especially network infrastructure. Furthermore, a comparable gross margin of 42.3% reflected improvements in its mobile networks division. Free cash flows are also positive for the company. I expect Nokia to continue improving its margins in the latter half of the year by reducing its costs further. Moreover, its 5G contract wins in China should strengthen its top-line position. On top of that, it is also benefiting from tailwinds in end markets. Nokia Is Expanding Its 5G Portfolio Perhaps the biggest knock on Nokia was its inability to ink major 5G contracts in the past year. Its competition landed some noteworthy deals, which pushed back NOK stock‚Äôs value. However, in the past few months, Nokia is back on track and appears to be pushing the needle in the 5G realm. In June, it partnered with Ligado Networks to strengthen its 5G portfolio. The partnership will allow the company to provide an improved service to its clients, particularly those in the United States. In the same month, Nokia announced the launch of the next generation AirScale 5G network.  The network allows for a lower radio access network (RAN cost of ownership, premium speeds and a cutting-edge 5G experience. Nokia could also capitalize on its competitor Ericsson‚Äôs (NASDAQ:ERIC debacle in the Chinese market. Sweden disallowed Chinese vendors in the Swedish network, to which China responded by cutting ties with Ericsson. Hence, Nokia has an incredible opportunity to carve out a share in the massive Chinese market. NOK Stock Is Finally Back on Track After years of struggle to find direction with its business, it appears that Nokia‚Äôs comeback story is in motion. It continues to refine its 5G offerings and has been winning some major contracts of late. NOK stock is likely to end the year with healthy growth across its top and bottom line. Despite the recent gains, NOK stock is still trading cheaply and is a highly attractive investment at this time.

A Guidance Hike Bodes Well for NOK Stock Nokia raised its 2021 financial guidance in July after an improved performance in the second quarter. It now forecasts its revenues to fall between 21.7 billion euros and 22.7 billion euros compared to previous guidance of 20.6 billion euros to 21.8 billion EUROS The foundation for the hike was laid by the company‚Äôs impressive second-quarter results. It posted revenues of 5.31 billion euros, which came in 4.3% higher on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, constant currency net sales rose 9% from the prior-year period. The increase was driven by robust growth across all business groups, especially network infrastructure. Furthermore, a comparable gross margin of 42.3% reflected improvements in its mobile networks division. Free cash flows are also positive for the company. I expect Nokia to continue improving its margins in the latter half of the year by reducing its costs further. Moreover, its 5G contract wins in China should strengthen its top-line position. On top of that, it is also benefiting from tailwinds in end markets. Nokia Is Expanding Its 5G Portfolio Perhaps the biggest knock on Nokia was its inability to ink major 5G contracts in the past year. Its competition landed some noteworthy deals, which pushed back NOK stock‚Äôs value. However, in the past few months, Nokia is back on track and appears to be pushing the needle in the 5G realm. In June, it partnered with Ligado Networks to strengthen its 5G portfolio. The partnership will allow the company to provide an improved service to its clients, particularly those in the United States. In the same month, Nokia announced the launch of the next generation AirScale 5G network.  The network allows for a lower radio access network (RAN cost of ownership, premium speeds and a cutting-edge 5G experience. Nokia could also capitalize on its competitor Ericsson‚Äôs (NASDAQ:ERIC debacle in the Chinese market. Sweden disallowed Chinese vendors in the Swedish network, to which China responded by cutting ties with Ericsson. Hence, Nokia has an incredible opportunity to carve out a share in the massive Chinese market. NOK Stock Is Finally Back on Track After years of struggle to find direction with its business, it appears that Nokia‚Äôs comeback story is in motion. It continues to refine its 5G offerings and has been winning some major contracts of late. NOK stock is likely to end the year with healthy growth across its top and bottom line. Despite the recent gains, NOK stock is still trading cheaply and is a highly attractive investment at this time.

2021-11-09 16:00:48.462004,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,u/NeedCookies8,"Nov 4th, Schwab Market Data Massive Lag. I should really switch to Fidelity.","So I've been a Charles Schwab user since August of last year, 2020. I've been really thinking about moving to Fidelity for the last few months. I don't know why I don't just move my accounts to Fidelity. Schwab has a good platform (could be better), is a bank, the color blue lol but not a reason, Schwab gives me leniency with trading for the $25k rule and more, and good customer service but so does Fidelity I've heard. Schwab just feels easy and comfortable because I've basically been using them since I've been investing. Throughout this year I've been considering moving to Fidelity because there have been some small things that have happened with StreetSmart Edge and just trading with Schwab in general. I do day trade and also do long-term investing. There have been times where it has taken 10 seconds to a few minutes for my cost basis/ cost per share to pop up on the screen and I have lost out on money and lost money because of this before. I'd put up with it about 6-8 months ago when that happened and hasn't happened since. It happened a few times. I haven't run into that problems since then, mainly because I haven't been placing trades as often as I used to. Something happened last week though with Schwab's desktop trading app and updating market data. Last week though... this is really what has gotten to me and honestly, when this happened I was really pissed and shocked at what was going. I sort of had no idea what to think. I called customer service after this happened, and they took down what I had to say and looked into it with the tech division or whatever division that handles market matching data. They didn't call me back after I asked them to, it was fixed a few minutes later and didn't happen again. I took a couple of screenshots of my trading screen of SSE alongside by side with Fidelity's Active Trader Pro Trading app. I saved another screenshot along with this one, but deleted the other picture (thankfully I saved at least one screenshot I took) because at the time I was going to post here on Reddit about it, but decided not to at the time because 1) I didn't have time, 2) I thought it would be taken care of (which it was), 3) it was fixed so thought it wasn't an issue anymore and it remains not an issue, and 4) because I was lazy that day/ last week and deferred writing this post until tonight. Since the 4th of November last week I have forgotten about it a little, but has been in the back of my mind since, so I am writing this now. Maybe this was just a small issue/ glitch in the system at the moment and isn't how Schwab runs things on their servers. Possibly this is a stupid post, but I don't think so. So onto it.. Last week on November 4th, I had Fidelity's Active Trader Pro and Schwab's SSE programs up to look at the market data because I've noticed all the time that Schwab doesn't print the time and sales for all transactions while Fidelity does. Schwab updates the current bids and asks that are at the top of the ask/ bid table along with the other bids and asks (that match with Fidelity, other than Schwab that does lump together orders for the same price mostly), but then doesn't print all of the sales in premarket and I'm sure for the market times as well. I have direct trading and level 2 data. Sometimes during market hours, I notice this. Maybe I don't have all of the exchanges listed for the printing of sales or something. There will be transactions that Schwab doesn't print that Fidelity prints. So, when I want to sell something I am thinking of the wrong price to sell it at because I am seeing a sell at a certain price and thinking, oh I'll set my limit to this price, even though Schwab is listing the current bid and ask, but the time and sales aren't being listed. So I set my limit to a price near the bid of the last price usually and also look at the bid and it fills and I wonder why my sell is a higher price than what I am seeing for the last time and sales, same with buying. This is because Schwab doesn't list all of the time and sales, so I am not getting all of the current market data to put orders in. I'm sure the sales of my orders go for what the market is going for at the best price since I cannot see all the time and sales on Schwab, and Fidelity shows the price I can see that it's the best price at the time of my order fill. Okay... back to what I am here to write about. Nov 4th, around 10:15ish AM EST to about 10:19-20ish AM EST, I was looking at Microsoft, MSFT, and Apple, APPL, between SSE and Active Trader Pro. Schwab was showing prices were selling for between $0-2 lower and higher depending on if the candle was green or red, compared to Fidelity. I was timing Fidelity's and Schwab's price action and Schwab was about 20 seconds or so behind in updating what Fidelity was showing, if not more. I manually timed the change in price to Fidelity and that's where I get 20 seconds. This all was happening fast so it was hard to document. I should have screen recorded, but I didn't think of that at the time. In the picture below it shows Fidelity keeping up with the time and sales of the current time and Schwab is 12 minutes behind on the time and sales, but Schwab is only 12 minutes behind on the time part. Schwab was still over a $1 difference than what Fidelity was showing, and this was between $0-$2 difference, the difference fluctuated throughout this 4-5 minute window I was looking at MSFT and AAPL. I only show MSFT here because I only took a screenshot of MSFT. I was looking on the Schwab mobile app, Fidelity's mobile app, and as well as the prices on the internet, Fidelity was showing the right prices. Through these 4-5 minutes, the real price did change $0-2 on Fidelity because of well trading, which was the real price in my eyes. Schwab was behind on the prices.. when AAPL or MSFT was showing green on Fidelity $0-2 change from the opening candle, Schwab was showing red and $0-2 change from its opening candle. Then the opposite was for a red candle on Fidelity.. Schwab was showing a green candle and $0-2 change. It was more towards $1.50 change, there was $2 difference I could see, but not a lot of trades during this time so roughly $1-1.50 was noticeable, but there were trades $2 apart I saw. Schwab's software seems to not be the greatest, or at least just a massive lag during this time. I wish I just recorded my screen because it would have been much better to express what was going on. I loaded up the ""Snipping Tool"" and chose a ""2 second time delay"" for the snipping tool to freeze the screen so I could refresh all of the time and sales window total history for Fidelity before the screen froze. Fidelity's time and sale tape are also visible, I just thought it would be good to have the time and total history sales up as well. As you can see in the photo below on the right is StreetSmart Edge and on the left is Active Trader Pro. The current time was 9:18 AM CST time for me, so 10:18 AM EST trading time. Schwab is displaying time and sales at 10:06 AM EST while Fidelity is showing 10:18 AM EST which was the current time. Fidelity shows MSFT at the last trade price of roughly $335.22, while Schwab is showing a price of $334.055, while the bid was at $334.04 and ask at $334.06 for Schwab. Fidelity was also showing a bid and ask price around what the real price was going for which was roughly $335.22 at the time. I whited out too much info for the Fidelity side by accident because my account number was showing and I was planning on keeping extra copies of my screenshot but that didn't happen, so this is the only copy I have that I whited out. You cannot see Fidelity's bid/ask prices here, as well as the last traded price of the time and sale tape, but you can see the last traded price above for the total history. Looks like there was an update to the sales when I refreshed the history sales and the time and sales tape, or the total history was faster than the tape. I assure you the bid and ask for Fidelity was around the last traded price of MSFT which was $335.22. Either way, the price for Fidelity is more right and Schwab was Drastically behind. Even though Schwab had the wrong time on their time and sales by 12 minutes the chart was showing being updated to the right time frame, but the prices were off. In this instance, the price difference was $335.22-$334.055 = $1.165. The price was off by more at other times, but for this screenshot, it was $1.165. I wish I recorded the screen because it would have shown all of the information and would have been better to see what was going on I can tell you that for sure! Fidelity Green or Red by $0-2 and Schwab the opposite by $0-2. I told this information to a Schwab Broker and the problem was fixed after about 10:20 AM EST, but still, this isn't cool. I compared SSE's information with AAPL and MSFT with Fidelity's platform and all was good I believe after 10:20 AM EST. I still checked throughout the day between the two platforms just to make sure, and everything did line up after 10:20 AM EST. Although minutes don't matter in terms of weeks or month-long trading or holding long term if you're day trading or short term trading this matters. I shouldn't be day trading or short-term trading, but I am to make money, and because I want to. This isn't what I want to be seeing from my broker. I should switch to Fidelity after having to experience this. I have used Schwab for my brokerage, Roth IRA, and checking accounts, but maybe it's time for a change. Schwab does have a great platform but it could use updating. I am sure that'll happen when they merge TDA's platform with SSE.   TL:DR: On November 4th, from roughly 10:15 AM to 10:20 AM EST I was comparing Schwab's bid & ask and time & sales to Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform. I compared AAPL and MSFT information, I only took a screenshot of MSFT. Schwab was showing different data in terms of pricing by shown here at $1.165 difference. I was seeing a difference in about $0-2 in sales pricing. I have only one screenshot. I whited out some info but whited out too much info here because I had other copies of my screenshots but accidentally deleted them. Schwab fixed their market prices after I called them, but still not good to be happening on their platform. It's not like this was happening on purpose, it's just something that was happening with Schwab's services. I have used Schwab for mainly all of my investment accounts, but maybe it's time to move. I do like Schwab a lot though. After this, I should probably switch.  Hopefully this isn't taken down lol. I haven't had a post on WSB before and it would be cool to not have this taken down, so people can see why Fidelity is better!","Nov 4th, Schwab Market Data Massive Lag.

I was timing Fidelity's and Schwab's price action and Schwab was about 20 seconds or so behind in updating what Fidelity was showing, if not more. I manually timed the change in price to Fidelity and that's where I get 20 seconds. This all was happening fast so it was hard to document. I should have screen recorded, but I didn't think of that at the time. In the picture below it shows Fidelity keeping up with the time and sales of the current time and Schwab is 12 minutes behind on the time and sales, but Schwab is only 12 minutes behind on the time part. Schwab was still over a $1 difference than what Fidelity was showing, and this was between $0-$2 difference, the difference fluctuated throughout this 4-5 minute window I was looking at MSFT and AAPL. I only show MSFT here because I only took a screenshot of MSFT. I was looking on the Schwab mobile app, Fidelity's mobile app, and as well as the prices on the internet, Fidelity was showing the right prices. Through these 4-5 minutes, the real price did change $0-2 on Fidelity because of well trading, which was the real price in my eyes. Schwab was behind on the prices.. when AAPL or MSFT was showing green on Fidelity $0-2 change from the opening candle, Schwab was showing red and $0-2 change from its opening candle. Then the opposite was for a red candle on Fidelity.. Schwab was showing a green candle and $0-2 change. It was more towards $1.50 change, there was $2 difference I could see, but not a lot of trades during this time so roughly $1-1.50 was noticeable, but there were trades $2 apart I saw. Schwab's software seems to not be the greatest, or at least just a massive lag during this time. I wish I just recorded my screen because it would have been much better to express what was going on. I loaded up the ""Snipping Tool"" and chose a ""2 second time delay"" for the snipping tool to freeze the screen so I could refresh all of the time and sales window total history for Fidelity before the screen froze. Fidelity's time and sale tape are also visible, I just thought it would be good to have the time and total history sales up as well. As you can see in the photo below on the right is StreetSmart Edge and on the left is Active Trader Pro. The current time was 9:18 AM CST time for me, so 10:18 AM EST trading time. Schwab is displaying time and sales at 10:06 AM EST while Fidelity is showing 10:18 AM EST which was the current time. Fidelity shows MSFT at the last trade price of roughly $335.22, while Schwab is showing a price of $334.055, while the bid was at $334.04 and ask at $334.06 for Schwab. Fidelity was also showing a bid and ask price around what the real price was going for which was roughly $335.22 at the time. I whited out too much info for the Fidelity side by accident because my account number was showing and I was planning on keeping extra copies of my screenshot but that didn't happen, so this is the only copy I have that I whited out. You cannot see Fidelity's bid/ask prices here, as well as the last traded price of the time and sale tape, but you can see the last traded price above for the total history. Looks like there was an update to the sales when I refreshed the history sales and the time and sales tape, or the total history was faster than the tape. I assure you the bid and ask for Fidelity was around the last traded price of MSFT which was $335.22. Either way, the price for Fidelity is more right and Schwab was Drastically behind. Even though Schwab had the wrong time on their time and sales by 12 minutes the chart was showing being updated to the right time frame, but the prices were off. In this instance, the price difference was $335.22-$334.055 = $1.165. The price was off by more at other times, but for this screenshot, it was $1.165. I wish I recorded the screen because it would have shown all of the information and would have been better to see what was going on I can tell you that for sure! Fidelity Green or Red by $0-2 and Schwab the opposite by $0-2. I told this information to a Schwab Broker and the problem was fixed after about 10:20 AM EST, but still, this isn't cool. I compared SSE's information with AAPL and MSFT with Fidelity's platform and all was good I believe after 10:20 AM EST. I still checked throughout the day between the two platforms just to make sure, and everything did line up after 10:20 AM EST. Although minutes don't matter in terms of weeks or month-long trading or holding long term if you're day trading or short term trading this matters. I shouldn't be day trading or short-term trading, but I am to make money, and because I want to. This isn't what I want to be seeing from my broker. I should switch to Fidelity after having to experience this. I have used Schwab for my brokerage, Roth IRA, and checking accounts, but maybe it's time for a change. Schwab does have a great platform but it could use updating. I am sure that'll happen when they merge TDA's platform with SSE.   TL:DR: On November 4th, from roughly 10:15 AM to 10:20 AM EST I was comparing Schwab's bid & ask and time & sales to Fidelity's Active Trader Pro platform. I compared AAPL and MSFT information, I only took a screenshot of MSFT. Schwab was showing different data in terms of pricing by shown here at $1.165 difference. I was seeing a difference in about $0-2 in sales pricing. I have only one screenshot. I whited out some info but whited out too much info here because I had other copies of my screenshots but accidentally deleted them. Schwab fixed their market prices after I called them, but still not good to be happening on their platform. It's not like this was happening on purpose, it's just something that was happening with Schwab's services. I have used Schwab for mainly all of my investment accounts, but maybe it's time to move. I do like Schwab a lot though. After this, I should probably switch.  Hopefully this isn't taken down lol. I haven't had a post on WSB before and it would be cool to not have this taken down, so people can see why Fidelity is better!"

With a market cap of 2.18B, that's  0.4/2.18 = 18% of their whole market cap. THAT IS INSANE. If your tits aren't already perked up from hearing this consider the sharp reduction in shares float. $400M tendies / $21.64 share price = 18.5M shares. Taking this off of shares float is, similarly, an 18% concentration of stock we'll see. If you're still confused I'ma need you to add another wrinkle right now in that peewee brain because what this means is that there will be less sellers and more buyers as more shares are kept with the big boi company itself. Normally this doesn't mean much. AMD is doing a buyback program along with MSFT and several others. So what makes this different? a) the sheer investment/market cap ratio. AMD for example is $4B investment/ 180B market cap = 2%. thats dogshit. and more importantly b) the fact that they want to complete this buyback program by the end of February. The short duration of it is the most critical aspect of this because that means this upward trajectory is going to be aggressive as fuck! And it means it can be calculated. TLDR reasons to buy in:  So whats the play? We're going with the May 20th, 2022 Calls at the $23 strike. I look forward to seeing your posts of thicc gains.","DD inbound - Bullish projections on $BBBY Opportunity to evolve your smooth brains to have at least a few wrinkles so take out your pad, we're diving in.

Converting my small $800 investment into $22,000 within these said 2 weeks. NVDA Price action always follows the same pattern from what I have noticed. We open high and its either push higher or come crashing back down only to recover later during power hour or the following day. For the last 3 trading days NVDA has had some amazing price movements. Giving me the ability to turn 800 into 22 thousand. At one point reaching $42k but as a true autist I did not sell. This stock has given us some amazing returns YOY. For tomorrow we can expect NVDA to break to new ATH (if it is able to break through 314). We can see a very bullish case of 314, 317, 320, 338. I am not saying this will happen tomorrow or the next day. All I am saying is if we break through tomorrow we can make some sweet tendies.   Yesterday I gave a trade idea which I did not take due to going deep into nada. This call out was AMD $145C Nov 12. These were trading at 1 and went up to 10.6 over 2 days. They won MSFT and METAs business. However, I believe that NVDA will run tomorrow since they also have an event regarding their omniverse business. For tomorrow $320 weeklies will be hot. See chart above for a clear view of this bullish pennant. With that I wish you guys luck and lets make some money. Positions: NVDA $320 Nov 12 x 10","NVDA - an autist bullish case Good evening ladies and gents, For the last 2 weeks I have traded NVDA every trading day.

And most of you newbies have not ever traded in a bear market. You subconsciously believe 100% runups in 15 months is fairly normal. Evergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real. Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood. Why isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market. Just watch the Big Short again, there is a substantial period where swaps are not priced properly even as defaults skyrocket, as various investment banks try to get ahead of the crisis and ""head for the exit in a crowded theater."" IMO, the people who are going to hurt the most are the thetards who have been selling naked puts and making bank for the past year and don't realize how exposed they really are.

Volatility is way undervalued given all the near-term concerns and it's entirely possible for some of the big ticker names out there to drop 50% over the next 3-12 months. Margin calls will fuel the downward spiral. This time, the public isn't going as supportive of JPOW's money printer because they'll be sick of inflation.

If we subtract these 34.226m shares from 85,774,688 (the public shares) we are left with 51,548,688 shares. So, the estimate of float is 51,548,688 + 14,852,765 = 66,401,453.

Squid Games has quickly become an international sensation after reaching 111M+ global viewers in more than 200 different countries. Squid games has brought a lot of hype to Netflix (and their original content) and has set the stage for an interesting Q3 2021 earnings report for their stock investors. Today, I am here to predict how Netflix‚Äôs Q3 earnings report will go, and a large part of this will be focusing on the growth of their platform in the past quarter due to their hit show ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù. At the end of this analysis, you will find a   Firstly, as we know, Squid Games had reached over 111M global users in over 200 countries in the past month alone. This in and of itself is impressive, however factoring in their low production cost of $21.4M makes it exponentially more impressive. Squid Games was able to keep these costs low due to filming in South Korea (Internationally) which allows for actors to work longer hours and can bring the cost of production down. Top executives have predicted that the cost to shoot domestically (in Hollywood) would have been 5-10x more than Netflix‚Äôs cost of production. This series in particular has opened the floodgates for streaming services to shoot internationally, as many of them are now starting to express interest in it. Squid Games was a huge money maker for Netflix and has been estimated to be worth in the ballpark of $900M, which represents a return on their investment (production) of over 4,100%. Considering Netflix‚Äôs revenues last quarter were $7.3B, Squid Games is likely to represent a large percentage of their revenues in Q3, and since their margins are so impressive, it is likely that we see Squid Games have a role to play in Netflix having better margins on their upcoming earnings.  The most important factor that I derived from Netflix‚Äôs Q2 2021 financial report is the fact that their weighted average subscription price across all of their regions is $12.26. This will be very important in determining the revenues in Q3 2021. Furthermore, Netflix‚Äôs revenues in Q2 2021 were $7.34B, and their cost of revenues was $4.02B (54.73% of revenues).   I am basing Netflix‚Äôs revenues off of their previous revenues, plus the new revenues that are brought in by additional subscribers in this quarter. Firstly, to get the new subscriber figures I decided to take Netflix‚Äôs estimate of 3.5M in this quarter for the first 3 months, due to squid games not being added. This resulted in 900k new subscribers per month for the first 3 months, which adds up to 2.7M new subscribers in June, July, and August. Lastly, we needed the new subscribers for the month of September. This was more difficult to calculate as they released Squid Games this month which drove in far more traffic than usual. In order to get a proxy for how many new subscribers a ‚Äúhit‚Äù like Squid Games can bring in, I used the data from Netflix‚Äôs 2nd biggest show ‚ÄúBridgerton.‚Äù Like Squid Games, Bridgerton was released 1 month prior to their earnings report, and helped Netflix to beat their new subscriber estimates by 41%. However, since squid games is 50% more popular than Bridgerton was in their first month, I think it is reasonable to estimate that Squid Games can help Netflix beat their Q3 2021 new subscriber estimates by 61.5%. Increasing Netflix‚Äôs Q3 subscriber figures yield 5.65M new subscribers over the whole quarter. This means that in September, Netflix likely brought in 2.95M new subscribers mostly off of the success of Squid Games. Overall, if Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers June, their revenue generated for the quarter would be $44.32M (900000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in July, their revenues generated for the quarter would be $33.1M (900,000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in August, their revenues for the quarter would be $22.07M (900,000*$12.26*2 months). Lastly, if Netflix brought in 2.95M subscribers in September as a result of Squid Games, their quarterly revenues would be $36.16M. In total, it is reasonable to assume Netflix increased their revenues by $136.22M, bringing their Q3 revenues to $7.48B. However, Netflix has been reported to have increased their prices by $1 in many regions. To be conservative, we can assume a $0.50 increase across all regions, which would result in a 4% increase on average prices. This would then cause Netflix‚Äôs quarterly revenues to be 4% higher, totalling $7.78B. This would represent earnings beat of 0.28B (or 3.7%).  As previously mentioned, Squid Games is very likely to have increased Netflix‚Äôs margins. As a result of this we can conservatively estimate that Netflix‚Äôs cost of revenues is 54% of their revenues (as opposed to 54.73% in Q2 2021). By doing this their cost of revenues should be $4.2B  Assuming that Netflix‚Äôs other costs are the same % of revenues as they were in the previous quarter, we can estimate all of these other expenses to total $1.56B.  If these assumptions are correct, then Netflix‚Äôs operating income for Q3 2021 should be $2.01B.  Assuming Netflix‚Äôs Net Income to Operating Income ratio is the same (over the past 6 months), we can estimate that Netflix‚Äôs Q3 Net Income figure to be $1.25B.  Since Netflix has 442.6M shares outstanding, their diluted EPS should be $2.74. This would represent a 7% EPS  I think that Netflix is going to narrowly beat earnings, which in theory should be good for the stock. However, since Squid Games was released, the stock has been up 6-7%. As a result, I think that NFLX will not have a big reaction from their earnings. I think that they might open the next trading day (October 20th) up between 0-1% and close the day between -0.5% and +0.5%. If I am correct, then the best way that I could think to play this via iron condors. I think that a 600/615/635/650 iron condor would be suitable given ","Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù.
