Wednesday morning you saw massive Bull volume entering Google, despite only being up 1% premarket off strong earnings. Initial volume trading institutions to jump in and pump Goog to new all time high.  Yesterday we saw SHOP down premarket off mediocre earnings, and when SHOP bulls jumped in buying the dip, that triggered institutions to pour volume in, pumping off   I believe we are going to see the same today with FB, especially with Cathie Wood Jumping in. FB has been beaten up over the last 2 months and has dropped from and ATH of  I think longer term options are a great play as well, but I think todays calls is the best risk to reward based on previous patterns observed this week.

3,2021-10-28 22:50:14.139224,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,17.0,u/davidb12899,Roblox about to make you serious ROBUX!,"First, I want to state that this is conditional based on how the market acts tomorrow. At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time. From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.  There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day. Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play. Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider. Positions: 11/05 86c"

As usual the chip shortage still looms over tech companies such as Apple and with the new iPhone 13 release I‚Äôm questioning if it was as much of a success and as profitable as the company predicted. I‚Äôm not too worried necessarily about the earnings per share, I‚Äôm more worried about the outlook of the company for the rest of the year and going into 2022. The majority of Apples iPhone sales occur during the holiday season and I‚Äôm not sure if supply will be able to meet the high demand. Personally I feel like there is always the highest jump in iPhone demand every 3 generations due to the general trend of how the average consumer upgrades. Such as with the iPhone 6 to the iPhone X, then to the 13. Apple is amazing and like with many other companies, they have made many advancements and innovations but just haven‚Äôt had the chance to benefit from them to the fullest extent financially due to the economic and supply restraints brought along by Covid. The market at the moment is propped up by hope for the future, which I think is fine, it shows that more investors are bullish and in it for the long haul. Therefore I think Apple‚Äôs stock might be just fine for earnings and follow suit with the end of the year upward swing of the market even if earnings does not necessarily meet expectations."

Well, it‚Äôs now the largest company in the world. The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant. Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to  And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult! Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE. Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical. I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC. AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.üòÇ INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction. But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals. It‚Äôs supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think). Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely. Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything? If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. (I am not saying you shouldn‚Äôt buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult) As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely. With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter. TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults. Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker."

This policy disrupts the collection of data from a customer to be shared with other companies since before you can leverage an identifier for advertisers (IDFA) to help deliver customized advertising from an ad targeting platform. Now, if the customer opts out (which they are more likely to), your ad platform is more useless than it previously was. So what is happening? These companies don‚Äôt necessarily die off.

14,2021-10-18 22:50:32.972053,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,149.0,u/Stonkgang_,How To Pick BIG MOVERS üöÄ - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.," The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average ‚ÄúAverage daily range‚Äù for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it‚Äôs shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it‚Äôs our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let‚Äôs assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip). In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive. Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).   Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it‚Äôs potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position. However it‚Äôs not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let‚Äôs take a look at two names with similar ADRs.    2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.   As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you‚Äôre a day trader with a short bias.  One of the large misconceptions with beginner traders are that penny stocks provide a better chance of large percentage/monetary gains. More often that not this couldn‚Äôt be any further from the truth. For this example we‚Äôre going to compare two speculative names to keep things fair. Both names have almost no revenue and are therefore considered as speculative plays.    Since early February 2021 this stock has been in a downtrend with any moves higher being aggressively sold into. The volume has decreased on a weekly and daily basis which tells us there‚Äôs very little attention on the name and therefore it‚Äôs very unlikely we‚Äôll see any worthwhile movement soon. There is also currently no hype in or surrounding the sector. It‚Äôs current stock price is $5.60 and has an ADR of 4.47% 2. Lithium America. Another speculation name which has received quite a lot of attention across social media and amateur traders, however there‚Äôs a huge difference. Firstly the chart isn‚Äôt trending lower but the complete opposite as it attempts to break into all time highs. Secondly the volume is increasing which shows attention to the name is increasing and therefore a big move is likely (one has recently happened, we traded it). Thirdly there is a large amount of hype in the sector with similar names also being bought and gaining attention. The current price of this stock is $25.43 and the ADR on this stock is 6.73%   So in this example we have two speculative stocks both with little to no revenue. However the Penny stock NNDM has a downtrending chart, no hype, no volume and therefore almost no chance of breaking out.Lithium America on the other hand has a very strong chart, lots of volume, increase hype and therefore a great chance of breaking out. It‚Äôs irrelevant if you have $500 to invest or $500,000 as Lithium America in this example on any given day will provide a larger move and better return than NNDM. Not to mention that the likelihood of the move happening on Lithium America is far greater due to the points outlined.  The ADR can also be used to avoid bad entries using the simple mathematics and change of probability. If you‚Äôre looking to get into a name which has had no news, no increase in volume and isn‚Äôt set to breakout then you‚Äôll want to avoid entering if it‚Äôs already close to 1 ADR. Based on averages and the law of probability it‚Äôs extremely likely that in that scenario you‚Äôll be entering at the high of the day. The opposite to this is a strong name that‚Äôs holding its trend is reaching 1 ADR to the downside. If all other factors look good then the law of probability states you‚Äôre likely buying at the low of the day. On aggressive breakouts and large catalysts such as earnings we can use the ADR to determine where we take profits or when we may avoid a late entry. It's not uncommon for large catalysts like a big earnings beat to provide 3-5 ADR's on the first day. You can therefore once again use the data to determine the probability of continuation and a good/bad entry.  We use ADR to filter out the names which have the potential to provide us with a significant move. However they must also have a clean technical chart with some form of growth and/or growth potential. The ADR is the key number to go by Ideally you want to see a minimum of 3% ADR and ideally something within the 5-10% range."
15,2021-10-13 22:50:36.806481,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,20.0,u/MaybeRocketScience,Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging,"Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off. Would like to share my findings and have opinions on how to play this. The hedge fund in question is  I cannot mention the company, as: - based on quick calculations, they never reached the $1.5B market cap threshold, and are hence (appropriately) qualified per WSB rules as ""worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes"". - otherwise every single person on WSB would load up on puts or do whatever shit. Anyway, if you have minimal research skills you'll guess/find what I'm talking about. I'll call it Company X for this post. Company X has no meaningful revenue, and does nothing but lose money. In the management team, there's a guy who recently settled for fraud, for his involvement in another company (which recently collapsed). The stock used to have a total market cap of ~$20M, right now, after massive dilution (5x O/S in a few months), shares are trading higher and the total market cap is ~$650M. Company X has recently engaged in a flurry of M&A, spinoffs and whatever else, creating potential ""catalysts"". It's also heavily promoted by well known Twitter personalities. Not having the cash to fund such endeavors, they started issuing convertible notes. And here Hudson Bay comes into play. The hedge fund offered hundreds of millions $ to Company X in convertible notes with short expiration (note: company revenue ~$2.5M). Other warrants have been offered to them and, to a lesser extent, to other firms. As Company X doesn't make money, but spends a decent bit, they are now asking shareholders to approve early exercise of all warrants.  Very few warrants issued Pointing out that, without that, the company would be in a tough situation (and realistically the M&A activities might be gone):  A little nudge on the vote Hudson Bay Capital would have, including the convertible note, warrants for about 120M shares, which is more than the current O/S total (~100M). Dumping such truckload of shares wouldn't be feasible, with current volumes. Hence, I suspect they are pulling of a magic financial trick called Warrant hedging I know, what the hell is this, who the fuck trades warrants, etc. Warrants are basically call options, but they're issued by the company, hence the money would go straight to them if exercised. Warrant hedging means: - you hold a warrant at $10 - you place a short at $20 - your position is hedged. No matter where the price goes, you locked in a risk free profit. It's also an unsqueezable short, since you can't get margin called. The moment such warrants are exercised, you cash out of your position with $10 in profit, the company cashes in $10 from the warrant, and shareholders are left holding the bag. There are a series of things that make me suspect such strategy is being employed. The first is that the SI has gone nowhere but up lately, despite the supposed ""squeeze"" and the subsequent tanking. It's worth noting that high SI has been recently attracting flocks of retail traders, hoping for squeeze profits. Price action would look manipulated: whenever the share price approaches the warrant level, volume dries up until there's a rebound, often ""catalyst"" triggered. Then huge volume, price goes flat/down, rinse and repeat. HBC can place a de-facto risk free short anytime the price is above the warrants (lowest is $2.655). This leads to a situation in which they could, in principle, short a ton of Company X stock, wake up on the day after the early exercise is approved, and cover their position by exercising their warrants. No messed up price action, which they'd get if they were to dump their position, just a sudden spike in O/S. There are a few instances in which this may not be the case: - HBC actually plans to dump their position after early exercise is allowed. Whatever. - HBC plans to hold >$700M, close to 10% of their portfolio, in a single low cap stock with no revenue and dubious management. This would dwarf their  - shareholders vote against the proposal. This opens up a pandora box of deals falling apart, and potential default, for Company X. Considering that, in principle, the last could happen and create some turbulence, and looking at a SI of ~20-25%, I would think HBC is employing this strategy for a decent chunk, but not all, of their holdings. Last thing to note: the company has placed another ""catalyst"" (spinoff) one week after the vote, possibly to encourage retail not to offload their shares. This was originally planned for the day after the vote, but has since been postponed. It would help the hedge fund dump the rest of the shares. The question now is:  I bought some puts, was swimming in the green, getting hammered this week. Would you think puts for the spinoff week would work? Puts for this Friday? A month from now? And especially, could the warrant hedging just balloon the O/S without any meaningful price action when exercised? In which case, my puts would be fucked? That's all, thanks for coming to my TED talk tl;dr : the Hudson Bay Capital hedge fund is pulling off some serious fuckery"

I am mostly a lurker in here but I do post time to time. And recently, I am seeing an influx of bad rumours or advice that seems to be constantly circling around. So, I hope this post might be helpful for those that are kinda new into degen gambling.  Now, here's some common mistakes or rumours or bad advice that's circling around in reddit:    Also, do understand that if someone says hedgies are manipulating the market or things like that, be very sceptical. Are you sure that the person saying that isn't manipulating you? Are you sure that the person saying that is not some fund manager/high net worth individual influencing you to buy some shitty options that they want to sell? Market is influenced/manipulated by everything. Your buying and selling is also a form of manipulation. So understand this, don't fall for ""Hedgies manipulating this stock, if you buy it, you will stick it to the hedgies"" narrative. We are here to make money through short term positions, not to be manipulated by some idealistic rant.       You will find plenty of free materials online that might help you with it. If I were to give you a suggestion about a book, well, ""Option volatility and pricing strategies"" by Sheldon Natenberg may help you with it.   They work like insurance. If you are making 10% or maybe 500%üòÇ or maybe even more gains a year, it makes sense that you keep your wealth preserved. If someone is warning doom and gloom, you won't have to lose your sleep, because you know when the time comes, you won't be the  üíº holder.   The market will adjust the amount of special dividend that will be given. An options seller will also adjust the price of the options that you are going to buy. So, special dividend is a zero sum game or a rather negative sum game, cause you might create a taxable event which could impact you in the future.   Did you know that up until 2020, long term treasury bonds outperformed S&P 500 (dividend inclusive) for the last 20 years before that?  Although this trend will not be seen any time in the future any longer as bond yields are just too low. That's why we are finally seeing some inflows into stocks instead of outflows from it.   Taxes have destroyed many a gamblers life. They won money in a play. Sold. Then lost all or some of it in another play, in some cases (not all), you might actually owe taxes to the tax authority that you don't even have. This is a very country and individual circumstances specific thing, so I can't really tell you how best to save on taxes unless I know in detail about your circumstances. But for Americans hope this  Also, to add to this, I have seen probably some very dumb comments of people saying things like ""I would owe more taxes if I make more money that's why I am making less money"", don't be that guy.   You should also ask the question why I am writing this? What's my motive? Etc etc.     Remember, for every time you are buying something, someone else is selling those something. Technical analysis can easily show you where buyer and sellers are meeting the most in a condensed format. Understanding it might help you position, enter, exit and most importantly discipline your trades. Does it mean that you should just follow the cup and handle pattern and buy things? No. It is a tool, much like every other tool a gambler can have in their belt.   To understand CPI, you gotta understand the composition of the CPI. Some say, CPI doesn't include housing consumption, which is laughable.  You might see people use a source like shadowstats, which is essentially a completely flawed website. Here's some reading  Yes, CPI has some flaws, but it is not a sham like people try to make it out to be. If inflation is really 10% or 8%, why are commercial banks lending money at such a low rate? Wouldn't they have become bankrupt within this 2 decade?? Better yet, if you really believe that inflation is something percent, put your money where your mouth is and buy up everything you see in Walmart and try to sell that 1 year later also using the low interest environment in your favour.   Hope this helps in clearing out some confusion and have a nice night. And if you have seen or know about some other mistakes or misconceptions people have, please do share!"

To put this in perspective, Shopify did 2.9 billion in revenue with a 180 billion market cap. On top of that, Wish has 1.6 Billion in cash and no debt. I believe Wish is way oversold and undervalued. After processing new information (Q2 results and management outlook for upcoming quarters), Wish's fair value is $14.77 per share. At $6, Wish is massively undervalued, and current prices are likely driven by a market overreaction to the Q2 earnings report and bearish all around short term market sentiment. I sold my AAPL and TSLA shares and doubled down on Wish this week. Position: 20k USD in Wish shares at average prices of $7"

31,2021-09-29 22:50:54.829495,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,," For anyone that points out that DWAC/TMTG/future combined entity is pre-revenue, then you're absolutely right. But this stock obviously is not about revenue now, but downstream profit potential. Obviously, any projection of this sort into the future is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, but I will do my best to quantify future prospects. As a bit of backdrop, the whole merger process with SPACs is a bit complicated, but roughly current stock prices imply a value of $8B. Warrant prices imply a value of a bit less than $4B.  First, let us look at some of the potential segments of DWAC as a business:   Let's begin breaking down a few things. Facebook has ~260M monthly active users in the US and Canada and 2.9B worldwide. Many of the worldwide customers are significantly less valuable, and the US/Canada market was responsible for nearly half of 2020 revenue. Likely, the margins are slightly higher in the US because it is wealthier than most. As a rough estimate, FB's North American portion of the business is currently valued at around $600B (of it's total $1T market cap). Twitter recently announced it had 206 million ""monetizable daily active users"" (not children) world wide. 25% of these, or 51 million are US based. The most recent data I have is Q1 2021, which shows about half of Twitter revenue is US based. In other words, Twitter's ~50M monetizable users in the US contribute to a company worth roughly $25B. These numbers fall in line with Metcalfe's Law, which states the value of a network is roughly proportional to the square of the number of users. Because FB has roughly 5 times as many users in North America than Twitter, than it should be worth about 25 times as much. $600B/$25B = 24, so we are pretty close here. So what's this all mean? Let's run some scenarios. Suppose Truth Social is a free to use platform. The US and Canada populations are, combined, around 370M. Let's suppose for now 10% of this population uses the platform on a regular basis. I think this is conservative, as about half lean conservative, so this would imply one fifth of the target market engaged. If we apply Metcalfe's Law, we get to a value of (37/50)^2 * $25B = $13.7B. If 20%, rather than 10%, the value goes up not two-fold, but four-fold to $54.8B. If 25% (half of right of center), this pops to $85.625B. Keep in mind the above is values are ignoring conservative/populist movements in other countries which may provide additional revenues. Brazil (population > 200M) is a huge market with a populist Trump ally, and the CFO of DWAC is Brazilian. There exists a sizable populist segment in Europe, especially in eastern Europe as well. Critique 1: ""They don't have that kind of userbase yet."" Response: Absolutely true, and there is execution risk. However, current market values are significantly below long run potential. Personally, I think it is reasonable that 20% of America will be active, but discounting at 15% per year with 3 years to ramp, that is $54.8B/(1.15^3) = $36B current value. Critique 2: ""Advertisers will not want to advertise on the platform."" Response: That may be true to some extent, but companies still mostly care about $$$. Even if some advertisers refuse to use the platform those who use the platform may be met with higher engagement from users, who see a company that possesses similar values to them. One last thought on the social media front: a monthly subscription as an ad-free alternative may be possible.  To begin, I think it is helpful to present some numbers of other streaming services.  What is the point? People are becoming much more comfortable with paying for a bundle of content they care about. Let's run some hypotheticals:  The above results in $144/year * 15 million = $3.60B of streaming revenue annually. Keep in mind, the type of content here is not likely to be extremely expensive to produce, like Netflix's huge investments. Suppose this can be produced at $1.5B. That's $2.1B in profit that that segment alone. A $2.1B profit. If it can expand at 3% per year from there with a cost of capital of 10%, that segment would be valued at $2.1B/(10%-3%) = $30B. Obviously, we are not there yet. And risk to get there is large, but even discounting it by 15% per year for 3 years, we get $19.72B  The above gives the two primary segments a present value of $36B and $19.72B, totaling $55.72B. Even if you think I am being exceptionally generous and you think the company is worth 5 times less today ($11.14B), then the stock right now (valuation of $8B) is still 39% undervalued. Even if you think I am overvaluing the company by 10 times, then a $5.572B valuation (compared to $4B warrant), then warrants are undervalued by 40%.  The final element here is to point out the obvious. There are 80 million Trump voters, over 100M Trump supporters, and tens of millions of other, who might not like Trump, but are tired of big tech censorship and monopolistic behaviors. Trump is a unique figure who has the capacity to funnel that energy and support to a particular business venture. His megaphone is unrivaled. Many of his supporters are supremely loyal and would subscribe, even while the product is unpolished, to show support to a movement.  There is a legitimate case that the long-run prospects of DWAC/TMTG is massively undervalued."

Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real. Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood. Why isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market.

But what I found extremely interesting is the timeline of the news.  -about an hour later FB and it's other platforms experience an outage -around the same time or within the hour news breaks of the FTC complaints and news relating to the gov't trying to force the sale of insta and WhatsApp. So here's my theory. Also to me this sounds all tin foily but also slightly plausible. So I am reaching out to the apes here that are much smarter than me to help fact check or provide any insight. Or just straight up rip this statement apart if it is a crock of shit. Let's begin. So what I'm thinking is would it be far fetched to assume that these the outage is by no means a coincidence but rather planned? With the news of the whistle blower breaking out what if FB intentionally took their servers offline to either: A. Discretely purge records that would confirm whistle blowers statements B. Strong arm the gov't to drop the suit by blaming them on a future date for the outage and having public backlash force the gov't to back off. Why I think this might be plausible is for anyone that's familiar with the game Eve online it's a game that everyones plays on the same server at the same time all over the world regardless of timezone. Therefore the server is always on except for a scheduled downtime that takes the server offline to allow for patches and updates. Now FB is similar in the sence that it's an always on service and probably operates on the same server or set of servers (my guess I don't know). What if in order to get rid of any back end digital paper trails you would need to edit at the architecture/frameworks/coding etc (developers/dev ops chime in here I'm not one so this is purely speculative). Now in order to do so would that require the servers be offline? Alternatively point b. That one is a little more self explanatory people as we know are addicted to social media so it wouldn't be a far stretch to assume that if FB pointed the finger at gov't or another scapegoat and said they forced us to do it people would get into a fit and the outrage would be fierce since there's already alot of distrust of the gov't. Since we know FB loves their data and consciousness experiments (i.e Russian interference in 2016 election, and no this isn't a political debate so keep your idiologies out of it) but since they have a general sense of what the consciousness of a country or demographic would be thinking it wouldn't be hard for them to spin stories that subscribe to people's narratives. Because as we can all agree people are almost most accepting of stories that best fit their own internal narratives. So again this might be a wild conspiracy theory. I might just be regarded and over analysing so please if anyone smarter then me can fact check this that would be appreciated"

When a company gets to the size and scale of FB it makes some enemies, that's without question. But reading the news today about the 60 minute whistleblower interview, fb shitting the bed with their outages, stock crash, and all the other massive pile ons from the biden administration on every AG in country. Somewhat feels like an attack on the company from all sides. Is this just me or does it feel like there other forces at play?"

Generics‚Ä¶ Wait no, the company debt Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits Okay there is a room full of elephants and we‚Äôre over the weight limit so let‚Äôs let them out one at a time.  As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D‚Äôs and Wendy‚Äôs all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company‚Äôs market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I‚Äôm mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs right it‚Äôs TEVA. Viagra is clearly not the only drug I‚Äôm on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I‚Äôm popping them like tic tacs. And it‚Äôs the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crpyto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall. Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I‚Äôll be taking that later when I‚Äôm ready to go to sleep. Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need. Oh and if you‚Äôre not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn‚Äôt weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it‚Äôs a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I‚Äôm talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I‚Äôm paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don‚Äôt want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital. Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that‚Äôs just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA‚Äôs revenues comes from generics.  Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you‚Äôre not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA‚Äôs revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they‚Äôll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today‚Äôs prices (This is also a reason why TEVA‚Äôs stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.  There‚Äôs been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let‚Äôs do some ratios. If a giant company like J&J, that‚Äôs worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around ~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion. Are there any elephants left? I‚Äôm sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.  What‚Äôs valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices. You think i‚Äôm going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos‚Äôs ex-wife‚Äôs bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market). Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it‚Äôs more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you‚Äôre in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I‚Äôm coming back for you. What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I‚Äôve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.  Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark. There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They‚Äôve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating. Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That‚Äôs right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they‚Äôve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they‚Äôll keep holding for the price recovery. (Not investing advice)"

They also have about 42,000 patents (2k added in 2020), about 20,000 of that is in the messaging, wireless networking and old business. They won a patent lawsuit against FB in 2020 which i think is worth north of $1 billion alone so bunch of companies (US based likely) are trying to buy off the 20,000 patents from BB. There're 2,000 companies that are infringing on blackberry patents ( US buyers approached BB in 2020 Christmas to buy the 20,000 patents and agreed to a price in christmas 2020, likely in billions. So why is it taking so long? The reason why it's taking so long is because the folks that are short and sold you the call options are afraid of what the announcement will do to the stock price. Now that apes are behind the wheel anything over $1billion is going to sky rocket the stock. the buying parties have shared the patent sale info to banks and MM so now they're trying to drag their feet much as possible. they are afraid this will sky rocket and could easily hit $100 with help of WSB apes. Chen has drawn a line to conclude the sale by end of November latest. If not, he has buyers waiting in line who can go after those 2,000 companies infringing on those patents. This is going to be very interesting. good luck to apes and everyone here for helping blackberry(underdog). These shorts and banks and MM must pay!!

If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. You're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. So, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation: Burry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things. Dalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad. Buffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry. Wood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years. ============================================= If you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:  I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week. Take a look at this chart of TSLA  And compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:  Now with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. ""Burry is a value-shill permabear"" Burry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5.  ""Burry is smart but he is wrong about TSLA"" If you won't follow Burry, then how about following Wood?  ""Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target"" Wood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of ""do as I say, not as I do."" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. And lately, Wood has been selling TSLA.

62,2021-09-29 22:50:54.829495,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"A recurring theme over the past year has been one ‚Äòexpert‚Äô after another bashing index funds calling them a massive bubble that is waiting to pop. ¬†     But at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week‚Äôs issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we [1] should be worried about the index fund bubble!  The argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.    If you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up  If you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes  The problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.    If you look at this  Adding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it‚Äôs something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it‚Äôs not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market[4]. Now that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder  I believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.    The above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016). Finally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.  While researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund. As of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN & FB) account for more than 23% of the S&P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio. There are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation       I believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way! While the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close! Until next week :)  [1] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (>90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt! [2]  [3] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market. [4] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other."

Figured I might as well get fake internet points out of it. I started off hot in March 2020 with some PENN puts and some FB calls during the summer, all downhill from there.  I started with blowing up my Robinhood account during the huge recovery which was seemingly impossible, the mark of a true a-word. The biggest loss was about 11k on PENN puts. As you'll note, I sold on 9/23 for $0.41. These opened the next day at a high around $4 upon news of a public offering. Would have been about 58k profit instead of 11k loss if I held like a man.  Should have held but I have pussy hands. I then tricked myself into believing that Robinhood was a shit broker and that was my problem, when indeed I am just a shit trader. So I decided to wander over to TDAmeritrade. I started off and made decent gains off of PLTR on the November run-up and withdrew my gains like a good boy. Decided to redeposit those gains in 2021 along with some fresh powder and proceeded to blow it up quickly.   RIP TDA Because TDA has some of the worst UI in existence, please see my biggest losers via Excel magic below. I decided to buy into LVS while China was still getting railed by COVID, bought into AMZN after a massive move up, and bought some 0dte on TSLA   I thought calls only made money? So here I am about 38k in the hole (roughly) after 1.5 years. I've somehow tricked my brain into not being in a total state of depression, so that's a win. I'm on the sidelines for now just buying shares. But I'm sure I'll be back, I'm a true r-word at heart after all.

Few things I was curious if anyone has speculation or more clarifications: ""Well, it's a major portion of our portfolio. As I said, we cover three major areas; cellular, wireless communications and networking. So things that is relevant but it's not useful to us today in our strategic software part of the business and we retained all the embedded and all the site ends and all the encryption and security technology patent."" - John Chen  "" So this is an unusual year. So let's talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years. So it will not go away to zero, there are some recurring -- that most of them will not be with us. But, so it will not be zero, but it will be quite small, if this happens -- sales go through with one big year in this fiscal year 2022. If the patent sale does not go through, then the first couple of quarters will be low, because if the pattern sale is being negotiated right now, I actually are unable to do more other negotiation going on. So the pipeline basically is frozen, but it won't go away. So if the patent sale does not go through, I may have to suffer a little bit for the first couple of two, three quarters and then we will then assume the target 250 a year patent licensing."" - John Chen  ""The company limits its licensing activities in the quarter due to the negotiations and because of accounting rules which Steve will explain later."" - John Chen ""Further to John's comments regarding negotiations relating to a potential sale, licensing activities have been limited not only due to the ongoing negotiations, but also because revenue from additional transactions that could have been completed in the quarter would have been treated as contingent revenue and deferred to future periods. Therefore, had negotiations not been in progress, we believe licensing revenue would have been higher."" - Steve Rai  I also read Q1 2022 transcript, but it was disappointing and lacked info. Seem to focus more on QNX and IVY. Cushy notes from Q1 2022 transcript: ""The negotiation for the sale of a large portion of the patent portfolio are ongoing and good progress has been made.

For now, but they‚Äôre branching out. This is a brand new company we‚Äôre talking about. I literally know somebody personally who had their company acquired by Coinbase. They‚Äôre spreading their roots to more revenue streams so they‚Äôre not entirely dependent on transaction fees. Not to mention they already have Coinbase Pro, so people who want low fees can already get them.  Corn halved last quarter and they still saw enormous revenue and profits.

Technology in WhatsApp Messenger apparently is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of court, Blackberry got a positive judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a halt on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users. Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail. John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech company and can't disclose more. I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. (This might be huge as Salesforce bought Slack). Blackberry also gets free advertising on FB Instagram. Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing. Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology. John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares.  As we all know AWS has entered a multi-year, global agreement with BlackBerry (BB) QNX to develop BB IVY. Ivy benefits the whole value-chain  Modern cars and trucks are built with thousands of parts from many different suppliers, with each vehicle model comprising a unique set of proprietary hardware and software components. These components, which include an increasing variety of vehicle sensors, produce data in unique and specialized formats. The highly specific skills required to interact with this data. With BB IVY there is no need to worry about special automotive programming languages, hardware variations, or proprietary sensor data formats.  Data is the new Gold/Oil BB has had a vision to build a data analytics platform for years which they showcased at CES 2 years ago. In a Bloomberg interview, John Chen says the following in regards to BB Ivy ‚ÄúBy the way this project, we‚Äôve been working with Amazon has taken us probably about 2 years - we started this whole program 2 years ago at CES. We demonstrated a little piece of technology at that time, obviously not as elaborative as today..‚Äù. He goes on to say that this creates a recurring data business for BB. This point should not be overlooked! As a Mckinsey & Co report  ( Chen explains that Amazon is interested in BB for 2 reasons:   Take us to the MOON, Papa Chen!  üöÄ  üåô  üìà  "
69,2021-09-29 22:50:54.829495,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"I saw alot of DD on Paysafe that got me interested on Paysafe. Just to share my alternate DD, not on projections but valuations. How is Paysafe so much undervalued compared to other spacs. Bill Foley took paysafe public at a valuation of 9B with 4B debt. This valuation was conservative as Paysafe did not have any growth in 2020 due to Covid. 2B of the money was used to pay the debt which means investors got a good deal at $10 with market cap at 7B. Which means either Bill Foley paid 2 billion more or blackstone received 2 billion less. Either way, investors got a 2B discount. Fast forward to now, the market cap is at 6 billion with revised upwards guidance for the year at 1.55b compared to 1.5b, with 23% growth excluding divested business. This is impressive as in just over a year, they grew from 0 growth to 23% growth and increasing their operating income margins from 10+% to over 30%, helping them to their first ever net positive income quarter. However, as we know shorts attacked it just as any SPACS. What separates it from other SPACS was the valuation initially at 9B was already undervalued unlike many clean energy SPACS which has lofty valuation and unrealistic projections. Paysafe was projected base on 0 growth in 2020, and a mere 10% annual growth. Furthermore, given many recent fintech acquisition such as square acquiring of afterpay is upwards of 20x revenue. FB and Paypal have both indicate they see the digital wallet segment as a game changer, whereby Paysafe is already a established player in the segment for 10 years and is still further growing due to igaming. Microvision being a rumored acquisition for microsoft sustain its p/s ratio at over 800. In comparision, Paysafe p/s ratio is now under 4. I can assure you NONE of the SPACS out there has a p/s ratio under 10, with POSITIVE NET INCOME. The last confirmation that their stock is undervalued is management decision to acquire pagoefectivo and paysafety in an all cash deal as compared to recent acquisitions made by draftkings and square using solely stocks. So why such a steep drop. It was up 10% premarket initially due to earnings beat. Look what I found. AGAIN SHORTS ARE COMING. Short interest is at 5% at 17M already reported at JULY 30TH with around 50% short volume daily. IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY BY NOW. DAILY volume on average is 4m which means any squeeze would require shorts 4 days to cover. THEY HAVE TO BUY AT LEAST 4 DAYS WORTH OF THE ENTIRE FLOAT TO COVER, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SHORT SQUEEZES. 17m more shares already floating around. Share price would rocket further if shorts are forced to cover. PLUS many in the wsb community have already entered prior and are diamond handling now. I am sure everyone have seen different analysis all putting its target price from 15 upwards to 45. USING BELOW EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE GROWTH, VALUATIONS, FINANCIALS TO BACK THE SQUEEZE WHERE NO INSTI WILL EXIT. Those who would, would have already exited. This is the best short squeeze play around in my opinion as shorts blindly attack it cause its a SPAC. Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of ~12.5% (not far from Paysafe‚Äôs minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others: Paysafe‚Äôs share price with average of sector peer multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09 EV/Rev ratio : $83.91 EV/FCF ratio : $87.86 Average: $97.95 After eliminating outliers with highest multiples: EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75 EV/Rev ratio : $44.64 EV/FCF ratio : $44.18 Average :$46.52 Notes:  This is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2. Only when we unite, we become stronger and earn from short sellers. Btw, Grasso tweeted and hes still holding for his 45 pt too.  "

IMO, if this becomes a countrywide standard, this is gonna be a huge fine on a bunch of companies like Google, FB, Amazon, etc. The worst part is the tax  ex. If I made $3 bajillion selling oranges and 50 cents selling ads, the tax would be calculated   These companies could offload the tax onto their customers but that would probably deter customers and less companies will want to rent ads from bigger companies (if they make more money in total, the added charge will be higher) This will probably be a long term play (first actual tax will occur April next year) but my ape ass is looking for ways to play this and I can't think of anything below surface level.

71,2021-09-29 22:50:54.829495,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"ZipRecruiter ($ZIP) isn‚Äôt the sexiest company, but looking into their S1, I like what I see. ZIP went public in late May via direct listing. Only existing shares were sold as the company is already profitable, and they had no need to raise additional cash or dilute ownership. Since then the stock has had a floor of about $20, slowly rising to $27+ today, about a week before their first earnings call as a public company. There have been 3 notable events that have had an effect on the stock in this time: (1) A partnership with FB on 03August, which has pushed the stock up ~$1.50 (6%). (2) Initiation of research coverage by a number of financial services companies. Mostly on 21June, which caused the stock to bump ~$2.25 (10.5%). (3) A steady stream of conversion of reserve stock units to common stock and sales by early investors and executives. The last of these increase supply of liquid stock in the marketplace and clearly puts downward pressure on ZIP. But‚Ä¶. the amounts you see being traded are not substantial on the scale of a ~$3B market cap. (Look for Form4 on SEC.gov for these sales) From the looks of it, it‚Äôs C-level execs cashing out ~$50-250k here and there. Nothing compared to the 85+ million shares sold (out of a fully diluted 123m) in the direct listing. (That and most of the high-ups seem to have the bulk of their stock locked up in family trusts.) Plus, I assume execs are kept from trading right now with their earnings announcement next week. Speaking of‚Ä¶ Unlike most tech companies going public these days, $ZIP is already quite profitable. By the looks of their S1, they took advantage of Covid to significantly reduce their cost structure and run a tighter ship (Operating expenses dipped from $381m (2019) to $300m (2020), over 20%. That while the money they‚Äôre making per employer (‚ÄúQuarterly Paid Employers‚Äù in the S1) seeking employees via Zip went up 16% from ~$1100 to ~$1275. All in, the company ended 2020 with $86m in net income off of $418m in revenue.  ($64m of net income, ignoring a tax benefit.) Their Form 424B4 shows that the March quarter continued this trend, turning an $11m loss (2020) into a $13m profit ($20m). Revenues increased 10+% quarter over quarter. They were $20m cash flow positive for the quarter, with $135m in cash on hand against a little over $25m in convertible notes, the only debt listed. Last: The business. I like that this isn‚Äôt a sexy business. The company is profitable and well-capitalized, but what they do (online job marketplace) keeps them under the radar. And we‚Äôre at a place where employers are willing to pay out their ears to get warm bodies in seats. See recent headlines like: ‚ÄúMillions of jobs and a shortage of applicants‚Äù and ‚ÄúUS job openings hit record 9.2 million but businesses can‚Äôt find enough workers to fill them.‚Äù Which means ZIP‚Äôs customers are going to have more listings (+) and willing to pay even more for each of them (++). So, yep, I‚Äôm long ZIP and have steadily bought between $20 and $25."

Listen to your pet rock before listening to me. If you want a summary of what Matterport does: I'm not gonna copy pasta;  Ever since they were a SPECulation, I've been into MTTR. Wanted to write a DD on this sooner but had to wait for shares to issue out so that they'd get a $1B+ MC. This is kinda DD kinda Discussion, I'm not too sure what it is but I'm writing this to convince my wife's boyfriend to give me allowance to buy more. Real Estate Play? Wait... they just take pictures of houses and shet. idgaf. Housing market gonna crash and we're all gonna kiss Burry's ass again. Trash play. Well... sort of, let's do an analogy. If stonks go up, who makes money?  If stonks go down, who makes money?  Matterport is the tool that brokers use. They have contracts with Redfin, apartments.com, vacasa, etc Listing sites like Zillow and Airbnb also support user uploaded Matterport imaging. Buy, sell, rent, hotel, BnB, market up, market down, ERRYTHANG! In other words, they're gonna make money regardless of real estate market. Stats: bigger numbers lead to bigger tendies total revenue: $26.9mill (+108% YoY) Subscribers: 331,000 (+500+% YoY) # of Spaces under Matterport Management: 5 mill + Annual Recurring Revenue: $55+ million 150+ countries and counting Covid/Recovery Play: Is it too late to play covid? maybe, but Florida thinks otherwise. Online shopping/home improvement: Rather than annoying the living shet outta amazon by returning the 9/10 items you just bought, you can virtually place the item in your home and see how it fits or looks. When you're stuck at home gong crazy staring at the wall, you might plan your next trip. Resorts, hotels, parks, vacation sites. While everyone is stuck at home, these places'll use Matterport to instill as much FOMO as they can to get customers to line up once the pandemic is over. Other Streams of Revenue/Applications: Retail: You ever buy something at Ikea, bring it home, assemble it, and find out it doesn't fit correctly or it doesn't match the fungshui of your living room? Neither have I, but I'm sure someone has. And Matterport can help you see whether your curtains will match that bean bag you always wanted. Aside from this, retailers have instructions from corporate on their store layout and shelving. Matterport will play a big role in facilitating this so that these managers don't have to drive/fly to every city in their jurisdiction. VR/AR: They have a deal with Face mother f-ing Book. That deal was just for research and AI. You know what else FB owns? Oculus. MTTR can easily enter VR/AR space with their technology to enter the gaming and 'adult' industries. Short Interest: IDGAF about the short interest. They're gonna make bank and that'll lead to me to making bank. I like the stock. and tbh, I'm such an ape, I don't even know how to reliably check short interest. I just like the stock. PR: If you create the world's best invention; you'll still be dirt poor if no one knows about it. The same goes with stocks. Matterport just hired 2 new PR specialists in the past 2 months - a VP of Investor relations Soohwan Kim, and VP International marketing, Vivian Weiying Pan.

FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly. Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It‚Äôs unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.  TA says we‚Äôre reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).  Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1% from here at $370~$371 EWT says we‚Äôre reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance. Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term.

Reviewing the top five economies and their case trends ------------------------- Source : Worldometers.info USA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL China:  they lie about their numbers Japan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate Germany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base France:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up UK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop Keeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth. One political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out. So all the potential economic shut downs are still there. What is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping. The extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Now to valuations  shows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high. Note also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9. A book by O'Shoughnessy ""What Works on Wall Street"" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.  shows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average. The market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.  Not the Russel 2000 declined recently. Here are the price to sales of the mega techs, using data at Reuters.  This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example  use .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ. price to sales: MSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5 These clearly can fall and still be overvalued. Some have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote. Inflation ---------------------------------------------- A large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE. We think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is ""bad enough"" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as ""having a heart"" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops. But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly. Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase? The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time. I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start. The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing. What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now."

84,2021-09-29 22:50:54.829495,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"What's up fellow retards, I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, relative volatility index, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%. -Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 95% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (second upper and lower purple lines), known as the 68-95-99.7 rule. Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level. I generally use this to find stocks that are trading above +2 deviations to short/buy puts or at -2 deviations to buy calls/stock as these areas represent only 5% of the price action over a given time period and statistically, there's a 95% chance the price will drop back below or climb back above +2/-2 deviations, respectively. I did this with Amazon puts recently -   See my Previous SOFI and AMC, and AMZN, NVDA etc. TA's if you want examples of how this strategy works. AMC -  SOFI -  AMZN,NVDA -  NOW LET'S GET INTO SOME CHART PORN FOR SPCE!!! Here are our One Year and 6 Month Deviation Support and Resistance lines for SPCE -   This week was rough, SPCE broke through its One Year and 6 Month +1 Deviation support, then broke through its long term regression/mean trend line (middle line), and has seemed to want to cross some minor support around (-).5 deviations (dotted line on 6 month chart) in the immediate future. So, where should you be looking to add positions? The most important and nearest support deviation trend line available to us at this point is -1 deviations (bottom blue line) on both the one year and 6 month chart at around $26 and $25. This is where we will encounter some serious long term trending support deviation levels and will likely see bulls try to bounce the price off these two price levels as less selling pressure comes in. Furthermore, our relative volatility index is around 25 on the one year chart, and on the 6 month, we can see what's known as a ""divergence"" forming on relative volatility as the price continues to drop yet the index is slowly rising and is around 43 right now -   Should we cross -1 deviation, our next nearest support levels are at $14-16 price levels of -2 deviations on one year and the 6 month chart. This is statistically the safest buy zone for those who are extremely bearish on the stock and want to buy in or cover their short. However given the strong fundamentals of the company we will likely see some strong support forming at our -1 deviation support levels and hopefully a break out to the upside regression trend of $35-37 in the coming weeks once we bottom out. It should be noted that we have some slight support around $30 at (-).5 deviations (white dotted line) on the 6month chart, but it seems like the price is already making its move down to our next deviation support levels -   Good luck to everyone out there, buy that dip if we can hit support in the next week. Peace !"

Commerce revenue increased by $6.5M due to an increase in retail ($1.5M) and BarkHome ($5M) revenue. The increases of each were from an increase in product offerings and penetration within the online marketplaces. Cost of direct to consumer revenue increased by $4.1M from costs associated with an increase in active subscriptions. The cost of commerce increased by $0.5M primarily due to costs associated with the number of goods delivered to retailers and online marketplaces. The gross profit as a percentage of revenue improved to 60.4% from 56% due to the increase in Add-to-Box revenue. From 2020 to 2021, direct to consumer revenue increased by $129.8M which was primarily driven by an increase in subscription shipments and Add-to-Box revenue which increased by $15.2M, from $2.4M to $17.5M. Commerce revenue increased by $24.5M which was primarily driven by retail and BarkHome revenue. Moreover, the introduction of products to new retail chains added to the retail revenue ($8.6M increase) and the increase in product offerings in the online marketplaces added to BarkHome revenue ($15.8M increase). Again, the cost of direct to consumer revenue increased due to consistent increase in direct to consumer revenue. Also, the cost of commerce increased primarily due to the costs associated with the number of goods delivered to new and existing retail customers. Direct to consumer gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to increased costs to inbound freight and royalty fees from license partnerships.  $ in thousands The change in Adjusted EBITDA results from an increase in revenue and gross profit in direct to consumer and commerce in 2021. There was also a decrease in pricing for social media advertising due to the pandemic which led to lower advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue [13]. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is the result of a decrease in net loss margin which was attributed to increase in revenue and gross profit in 2021. ._1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}._30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}._29m-SAo1wzA0dkdfJutrjs{fill:var(--newCommunityTheme-button)}

/*# sourceMappingURL=https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/chunkCSS/IdCard.cbbad04994ab955e4071_.css.map*/  In 2017, the American Kennel Club stated the cost of owning a dog from a puppy to senior years could range from $14.5K ‚Äì $15.8K while Forbes estimated between $17.6K ‚Äì $93.5K, depending on the size of the dog [2] [3]. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association in 2018, 48.2M or 38.4% of households in the United States owned dogs and the average number owned per household was 1.6 dogs [4]. The 2019-2020 American Pet Products Association National Pet Owners Survey showed 67% of U.S. households owned a pet which equates to 84.9M homes, 63.4M of which had dogs [5]. The first year the survey was conducted (1988) showed 56% of U.S. households owned a pet. The 2021 State of the Industry presentation on March 24, 2021 stated there are more pets today than pre-COVID which means more supplies ‚Äì food, beds, collars, leashes, toys [6]. As a result, there was an increase in demand and manufacturers could not produce quickly enough. COVID safety protocols meant enhanced cleaning, slowing machinery, and worker separation among other things [6]. Add competition from Amazon (and other competitors) with enhanced benefits and compensation which made it hard to fill open positions for production workers [6]. Supply chain challenges and shortages began February 2020 and demand surged in May for imported products. Some challenges continue today and are likely to continue through 2021 and into 2022 such as:  Overall, the demand is real and will not go away anytime soon. The increased costs for shipping and raw materials will be passed along [6]. Demand from a country full of pent-up spending energy has pushed all three ports on the West Coast to record import levels over the past year. Of the pet owners in 2020, 47% reported they increased the number of times they purchased pet products online in 2020 [6]. Total retail sales were up 6.7% with 30% of pet owners spending more on their pet in the past year [6].  Size of the pet industry 2020. $ in billions The outlook for the pet industry for 2021 and 2022 is bullish. Additionally, the pet care market size is projected to expand at 6.1% CAGR from 2021 to 2027 [11]. This growth will be driven by an increase in animal healthcare expenditure, growing pet adoption, rising prevalence of food borne and zoonotic diseases, and increasing demand for protein in foods [11]. The pet food segment accounted for $94.2B and the dog segment held a market share of 41%, or $96.5B, in 2020 [11]. E-commerce accounted for 17% of the revenue share in 2020 and is observed as a potential growth driver for the industry [11]. Additionally, there is a growing shift towards premium food which is boosting industry demand [11]. Changes in perception of animals, specifically dogs, in China and India will result in significant adoptions of dogs in the coming years. From 2015 to 2020, the worldwide relative search volume (RSV) for dog adoption peaked in April 2020 [12].  The peak as indicated the rectangle was observed following the WHO declaration of the pandemic  It only serves dog owners. This is a big one as it is leaving the rest of pet owners out leaving room for competitors to fill that section of the market. Of the previously mentioned 84.9M homes with pets [5]:   Size of the pet industry 2021. $ in billions Other areas of the market that are left untouched are medical/veterinary expenses. For instance, Veterinary Care and Product sales are estimated to grow $32.3B, or 3%, in 2021 [6]. Other services such as grooming, training, boarding, and walking/pet sitting will account for $9.7B, or a growth of 20% [6]. Moreover, it is a newer company that is still developing the product line when it comes to health. In turn, it leaves a large chunk of the 6% growth for Supplies, Live and over-the-counter medications, as well as a portion of Product sales, up for grabs for competitors.  I am bullish over the next 12 months. What happens after that will be determined by its ability to expand the products that are offered across all four categories. The direct to consumer business is primarily comprised of subscription products that are tailored to different aspects of a dog's life. This will allow it to grow with the owners and dogs for years to come.  3 Buy signals within the last 4 weeks  As of 7/12/21 in premarket. Options not listed: 7/16/21 & 2/18/22 Add the buy signals to the open interest over the next 4 months and that tells me the share price will go up. If the 63M households in the U.S. with dogs are anything like me, they spoil the shit out of their dog(s). Given the forecast for the pet industry, I believe it will gain market share and amass a larger following via social media. With a current 8.7M followers on social media and over 12M email contacts, it is poised to grow. I will accumulate shares especially now that it is near a 52-week low.

Commerce revenue increased by $6.5M due to an increase in retail ($1.5M) and BarkHome ($5M) revenue. The increases of each were from an increase in product offerings and penetration within the online marketplaces. Cost of direct to consumer revenue increased by $4.1M from costs associated with an increase in active subscriptions. The cost of commerce increased by $0.5M primarily due to costs associated with the number of goods delivered to retailers and online marketplaces. The gross profit as a percentage of revenue improved to 60.4% from 56% due to the increase in Add-to-Box revenue. From 2020 to 2021, direct to consumer revenue increased by $129.8M which was primarily driven by an increase in subscription shipments and Add-to-Box revenue which increased by $15.2M, from $2.4M to $17.5M. Commerce revenue increased by $24.5M which was primarily driven by retail and BarkHome revenue. Moreover, the introduction of products to new retail chains added to the retail revenue ($8.6M increase) and the increase in product offerings in the online marketplaces added to BarkHome revenue ($15.8M increase). Again, the cost of direct to consumer revenue increased due to consistent increase in direct to consumer revenue. Also, the cost of commerce increased primarily due to the costs associated with the number of goods delivered to new and existing retail customers. Direct to consumer gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to increased costs to inbound freight and royalty fees from license partnerships.  $ in thousands The change in Adjusted EBITDA results from an increase in revenue and gross profit in direct to consumer and commerce in 2021. There was also a decrease in pricing for social media advertising due to the pandemic which led to lower advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue [13]. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is the result of a decrease in net loss margin which was attributed to increase in revenue and gross profit in 2021. ._1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}._30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}._29m-SAo1wzA0dkdfJutrjs{fill:var(--newCommunityTheme-button)}

According to the American Veterinary Medical Association in 2018, 48.2M or 38.4% of households in the United States owned dogs and the average number owned per household was 1.6 dogs [4]. The 2019-2020 American Pet Products Association National Pet Owners Survey showed 67% of U.S. households owned a pet which equates to 84.9M homes, 63.4M of which had dogs [5]. The first year the survey was conducted (1988) showed 56% of U.S. households owned a pet. The 2021 State of the Industry presentation on March 24, 2021 stated there are more pets today than pre-COVID which means more supplies ‚Äì food, beds, collars, leashes, toys [6].

Of the pet owners in 2020, 47% reported they increased the number of times they purchased pet products online in 2020 [6]. Total retail sales were up 6.7% with 30% of pet owners spending more on their pet in the past year [6].  $ in billions The outlook for the pet industry for 2021 and 2022 is bullish. Additionally, the pet care market size is projected to expand at 6.1% CAGR from 2021 to 2027 [11]. This growth will be driven by an increase in animal healthcare expenditure, growing pet adoption, rising prevalence of food borne and zoonotic diseases, and increasing demand for protein in foods [11]. The pet food segment accounted for $94.2B and the dog segment held a market share of 41%, or $96.5B, in 2020 [11]. E-commerce accounted for 17% of the revenue share in 2020 and is observed as a potential growth driver for the industry [11]. Additionally, there is a growing shift towards premium food which is boosting industry demand [11]. Changes in perception of animals, specifically dogs, in China and India will result in significant adoptions of dogs in the coming years. From 2015 to 2020, the worldwide relative search volume (RSV) for dog adoption peaked in April 2020 [12].  The peak as indicated the rectangle was observed following the WHO declaration of the pandemic  OriginalBARK only serves dog owners. This is a big one as it is leaving the rest of pet owners out leaving room for competitors to fill that section of the market. Of the previously mentioned 84.9M homes with pets [5]:   $ in billions Other areas of the market that are left untouched are medical/veterinary expenses. For instance, Veterinary Care and Product sales are estimated to grow $32.3B, or 3%, in 2021 [6]. Other services such as grooming, training, boarding, and walking/pet sitting will account for $9.7B, or a growth of 20% [6]. Moreover, OriginalBark is a newer company that is still developing the product line when it comes to health. In turn, it leaves a large chunk of the 6% growth for Supplies, Live and over-the-counter medications, as well as a portion of Product sales, up for grabs for competitors.  I am bullish on OriginalBark over the next 12 months. What happens after that will be determined by its ability to expand the products that are offered across all four categories. The direct to consumer business is primarily comprised of subscription products that are tailored to different aspects of a dog's life. This will allow OriginalBark to grow with the owners and dogs for years to come.  3 Buy signals within the last 4 weeks  As of 7/12/21 in premarket. Options not listed: 7/16/21 & 2/18/22 Add the buy signals to the open interest over the next 4 months and that tells me the share price will go up. If the 63M households in the U.S. with dogs are anything like me, they spoil the shit out of their dog(s). Given the forecast for the pet industry, I believe it will gain market share and amass a larger following via social media. With a current 8.7M followers on social media and over 12M email contacts, OriginalBark is poised to grow. I will accumulate shares especially now that it is near a 52-week low.

Specifically, a visualization and breakdown of stocks that seem to ""keep running."" See  I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%. -Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range is within 1 statistical standard deviation of it's average/regression trend (2 blue lines), 95% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines), known in stats as the 68-95-99.7 rule. These deviations also function, generally, as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level. -ZTS - Moving on news and hype since 3/8/2020. Here is the One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart -  ZTS has currently broken through all deviation resistance levels over the past 4-5 months however it is now at over +2 Deviations on both the One Year and 6 Month chart which indicates it is entering extremely overbought territory. Both + 2 Deviation Support Levels are $195. Should it crack through that soon, we should see prices back down to the +1 Deviation Support Level or $185. Now is not a good time to enter. The Stock has entered its selling phase and can easily crash a full deviation price swing in one day. Should it manage to continue upward, we could see prices around $205 (+3 Deviations) although this is unlikely. -FB - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart -  FB has pretty much made it's long-term move for now. It was not able to break +1 Deviation Resistance around 355-358 on the 6 Month Chart. And its +1 Deviation Support on the 1 Year chart is $350, which it broke through pre-market. It is entering the selling phase and we should see prices back around the $321-328 Area, its long-term regression trend, before any deviation support helps to bounce it. -AMZN - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart -  On Amazon's One year chart, it has tended to trend between +3 deviations, crash to -2 Deviations, then bounce, with most of the action happening between +1/-1 Deviations following the typical sine-wave like cyclical price pattern seen in many stocks. In the immediate future, it is, like FB, statistically overbought, hovering above +2 deviation support levels of $3500 and $3600 which it is likely to break soon and trend back to it's regression price of 3300-3350. Not the time to buy. -NVDA - One Year and 6 Month Deviation Chart -   It seems NVDA has finally completed its run up to +2 Deviation resistance on both charts, as you can see it bouncing off the 1st purple line this week. This indicates a bearish move to the downside after being extremely overbought the last 3 months. Our downside buy area would be between $665-678 and the immediate deviation support at +1 on both charts is $748-756 where it will likely try to hold trend before snapping down to it's regression trend line. Hope these images help you all visualize price trends of these stocks. Good luck trading today! ZTS -  FB -  AMZN -  NVDA -   "
89,2021-09-29 22:50:54.829495,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"Earlier, I wasn‚Äôt able to navigate creating a  DD post correctly to show the similarities between how FB and WISH were manipulated downward to shake weak hands off the stocks with massive long term gains ahead.  Market insiders who drove enthusiasm through the hyped FB IPO and the run up of WISH after its IPO make it their business to punish early investors with eyes on short term gains. They make huge profits on IPO run ups followed by shorting the very same hyped stocks mercilessly. 2. Why is this important? In the case of FB then and WISH now you see two stocks - one that got punished then and another that has gotten punished recently such their valuation levels made no sense. Both companies had post IPO had very little debt while experiencing rapid growth but their market cap dropped precipitously and in the case of WISH, to around 1.4 x sales. When valuations get out of whack like that and losses on individual investors force them to sell out of their positions, big investors always jump in to take massive long term stakes in which they reap massive gains. This then says to me that you should be patient in your investing. You could carefully invest using a number of strategies to make money without losing your position in a long term winner. Here are a few approaches: a. Average in your largest buys around large institutional investor buys as seen on level II trades b. Join the shorts with with PUT orders when algorithmic selling or manipulative downward price action is evident c. Sell LEAP covered CALLs if they are profitable d. Balance trading on margin to avoid margin calls Over time all that matters is that your trading account and positions in it are funded and not vulnerable to margin calls. A good early investment will usually prove to be one within two years. 3. What does this mean: Contrast manipulation vs value? First, understand that in the long run valuations matter. To get the best value an investor should pay the lowest price for a promising stock. When a stock price drops while the fundamentals of the company is improving like WISH who reported 76% YoY revenue growth but fell to $7.52 after hitting a $32.85 high you have to wonder why. Well a buyer at $32.85 now has the worst value given the stock is now worth $11.78. A buyer on the other hand who bought at $7.52 or near about like I did has the highest value especially knowing that the company‚Äôs revenue is significantly increasing. Second, we as investors must learn to follow the money. Big buy orders that we have seen since the 52-week low of $7.52 has produced massive trading volume. Massive trading volume with increasing price per share and algorithm-based pullbacks are signs of extraordinary long term gains as seen in FB. And, if you go back to AAPL in roughly 2004 and 2005 you see similar price action and volume followed by the enormous gains that APPL has since produced. Manipulation is to me disingenuous price increase or drops against valuation. At either end whether through hype or unfounded bashing the unsuspecting and inexperienced investor is bound to lose. 4. Why did I deem FB and WISH price drops as manipulation? When a disruptive technology enters the market and is run up early only to reverse and drop over  50% and sometimes down 90% there to me is no other explanation that big investor pump and dump market manipulation. I do not claim this to be scientific analysis but rather common sense. To make one feel as though their initial investment was a bad one only to later reveal sometimes 200-fold gains is similarity someone telling you your winning lottery ticket was a loser. To me it should be criminal when big investors colluded with unscrupulous Law Firms who file fake lawsuits and post them all over every brokerage site or financial website and paid bashers are employed to drive down a stock price to encourage individual investors to sell their stakes at a loss as I believe is being done in the case of WISH."

Both parties settled out of count , Blackberry got a judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a hault on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users. Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail. John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech co and can't disclose more. I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. Blackberry gets free advertising on FB Instagram. Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing. Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology.

92,2021-09-29 22:50:54.829495,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"PubMatic is a small-cap growth stock in the quite quickly growing adtech space, which may be facing further tailwinds from the reopening and trends such as CTV. Its valuation is lower than others in this space such as market darling The Trade Desk, while also growing faster. Large growth prospects and a reasonable valuation, combined with a low absolute market cap, provide a recipe for a successful investment. Buy potential multi-baggers while they‚Äôre small. Investment Thesis One of the core tenets of growth investing is a company‚Äôs relatively small market cap in light of a potentially large long-term opportunity. A small company with a differentiated technology or product in a large market could deliver supercharged returns if it keeps growing. This may exactly be the case with PubMatic (PUBM). The company operates an adtech platform, has a reasonable valuation, is growing fast, and has the relatively small market cap that growth investors would look for. I would contrast this stock with The Trade Desk (TTD). While they‚Äôre not exactly competitors, both operate in the adtech space. However, The Trade Desk has the opposite characteristics: while the company also reports respectable growth, it already has a much larger market cap and a high P/S valuation. Put differently, though, the investment thesis is that potentially PubMatic could replicate on the sell-side of this market what The Trade Desk has accomplished (both as a business and as double digit-bagger on the stock market) on the buy-side. Company overview As indicated, PubMatic operates in the adtech space. The company provides a sell-side cloud infrastructure platform purpose-built for digital, real-time programmatic advertising. As such, the company should benefit from general ad spend growth as well as some of the higher-growth areas in this space such as programmatic CTV (connected TV). PubMatic also expects some acceleration tailwinds from the reopening. In¬†succinct terms: PubMatic has created a sell-side ad tech platform that leverages data-driven algorithms and tools to help content publishers and app developers maximize the value of their ad inventory. The reasoning behind such an infrastructure-driven approach is that advertising is inherently data-intensive, and also real-time. Hence, PubMatic can deliver increased value (such as higher revenue for publishers and higher ROI for buyers), and also innovate faster, by controlling the full stack from hardware to software. This also results in a cost advantage. The alternative approach is using public cloud infrastructure, which only allows for controlling the software stack. PubMatic also claims it benefits from consolidation of ad budgets on fewer sell-side platforms, resulting in increased market share. This occurs through Supply Path Optimizations or SPOs. As evidence for this trend, PubMatic disclosed that revenue from those arrangements nearly doubled in Q1. Lastly, to come back to the term ‚Äúsell-side‚Äù. This can be contrasted to The Trade Desk, which is a demand-side or buy-side platform. In simple terms, the buy-side are those who buy advertising inventory, while the sell-side are those who offer ad space, anywhere on the internet. As such, the thesis really is that PubMatic may become (both as company and as a stock) on the sell-side what The Trade Desk has become on the buy-side. Q1 results In Q1, PubMatic reported $43.6M revenue, up 54% YoY. In particular, mobile and omnichannel video grew 83%, and represented 63% of total revenue. CTV grew 55% QoQ. Gross margin also increased from 65% to 72% due to increased utilization. This signals a scalable business. PubMatic‚Äôs accelerated growth over the last year is also evidenced by its increased TTM net retention, which has expanded from 112% to 130%, which is best-in-class for growth companies in general. Guidance PubMatic has guided for 33% growth for the year. While this implies a slowdown, some part of it does seem like sandbagging or conservative guidance: as discussed, the net retention was 130% in Q1, and growth in mobile and video also grew markedly faster than the overall business. Valuation PubMatic‚Äôs valuation should be considered compelling. At the stock‚Äôs current ~$40 price, the forward P/S stands at ~10x, which is over 3x cheaper than The Trade Desk. Obviously, the bullish case would be that given that both operate in the same market, PubMatic could deliver similar growth as the former, which would result in both long-term stock and valuation expansion. Although PubMatic certainly does not yet have same multi-year track record of elevated revenue growth yet as The Trade Desk, this stark difference in valuation arguably well offsets potential execution risks. At least in Q1, PubMatic was growing faster than The Trade Desk. Risks PubMatic‚Äôs growth has accelerated since COVID-19, and the company also expects continued tailwinds from the reopening, which should result in increased ad spend. However, a risk would be if growth would slow down to pre-pandemic levels; obviously, the best growth stocks, including The Trade Desk, are able to sustain elevated growth for years. Another potential risk are some of the recent and ongoing changes in the ad space, including changes in Apple‚Äôs (AAPL) policy and the phasing out of third-party cookies. However, PubMatic reports that the majority of its revenue comes from different identifiers than those two. As such, PubMatic actually views this is a competitive advantage, similar to how The Trade Desk has been¬†boasting about¬†how the Open Internet will prevail over the walled gardens. PubMatic is in fact investing in a portfolio of alternative solutions to the third-party cookie, including The Trade Desk‚Äôs UID 2.0 as well as Google‚Äôs (GOOG) (GOOGL)¬†Privacy Sandbox¬†(which includes the contested FloC). Note that The Trade Desk and PubMatic are not really competitors but rather partners, as The Trade Desk is a demand side platform. PubMatic says it is integrated with around 100 such platforms. A last risk I found was that although PubMatic especially touts its infrastructure, the company nevertheless seems to get more mixed reviews (i.e. a lower rating than TTD). This could imply it still has some way to go to truly become best-in-class. Primer on ads and cookies This section serves for those who aren‚Äôt all too up-to-date on some of the terms used here. As I would describe it, the core issues stem from privacy concerns regarding (third-party) cookies and tracking. This is leading to the phasing out of those cookies (now planned for 2023 by Chrome). However, this causes issues for the digital advertising market, which relies on targeted ads to increase their efficiency. As such, alternative, supposedly more privacy-friendly, tracking solutions are being introduced. One of the most well-known is The Trade Desk‚Äôs UID 2.0. Google, for its part, is backing on a collection of a few dozen of APIs, which it calls Privacy Sandbox. One of those is the controversial ‚ÄúFloC‚Äù, even though it does (more or less) achieve its goal to provide privacy without sacrificing targeting accuracy. Another point of dichotomy is regarding what some like to call the Open Internet vs. the walled gardens. The latter are the big ad platforms such as Google, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN). The gist is that those walled gardens have a privileged position given that they have an enormous amount of first-party data. Hence, they could survive the phasing out of third-party cookies quite unscathed. Some claim, for example, that it is in Google's interest to phase out those cookies, which could put Google at a competitive advantage as others would lose the ability to serve targeted ads. However, one might note that this dichotomy isn‚Äôt all that clear. For example, both Roku (ROKU) and Unity (U) (and likely plenty others) certainly wouldn‚Äôt be considered walled gardens among the likes of Google and Facebook. Nevertheless, both companies have said that given their own first-party data, they deem themselves to be quite unaffected by those changes in the ad landscape. Lastly, given the observation that there are so many alternative tracking solutions being developed, which may or may not conserve privacy, ultimately there may be relatively little tangible changes in the ad landscape. As such, the bottom line may be that the recent rally by the likes of The Trade Desk (due to Google‚Äôs Privacy Sandbox delay) is overblown. Investor Takeaway PubMatic offers a compelling proposition, both with its full-stack technology as well as with accelerated business results. In general, the company operates in the growing digital advertising market, and by being at the forefront with its technology and innovation, seems to be well-positioned for market share growth as well. The company has reported high growth, expanded margins, and a high 130% net retention in Q1. PubMatic is also capitalizing on the latest trends such as CTV, which grew 55% sequentially. While no stocks are risk-free, these are definitely signs that the company is able to capitalize on the growth opportunity in its adtech space. Just as importantly, compared to other growth stocks I have covered, both the company‚Äôs market cap and P/S valuation are rather low for growth stocks. That implies the risk is reduced, while the potential upside could be significant. Hence, bottom line is that PubMatic does not even have to exactly replicate The Trade Desk‚Äôs performance to deliver solid or even significant long-term investor returns. As I said about another small company a while ago,¬†Sumo Logic¬†(SUMO): buy potential multi-baggers while they‚Äôre small (and cheap)."

BeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD‚Äôs and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article   OpenFit (backed by Lebron & Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article  OpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness over 700 physical locations , giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link   A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer.But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition. I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one. Interestingly, Myx has sold over 27,000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month. The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at $1,299 is $600 cheaper than peloton‚Äôs basic bike.

Upon this deal closing, they‚Äôll have what they referred to as a ‚Äúwar chest‚Äù of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&A, marketing, and expansion.  The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10+ countries in the near future.  If you check company's website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers, almost 3.4 million paid subs, thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people. Celebrities backing this one Lebron, Shaq, and Arnold together have 70 !!!! million followers only on Twitter, on Instagram they have over 100 million!!!!. Insiders have also thousands of followers, so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people.  Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order to connect with each other, in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people, subs and coaches to connect each other. Lets talk about  Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in. What about???  Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are  Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes. Lets see if there is any  None. Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews  Finally most important      8.8% only public shares!  Monday $BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available (around 22-25) for shareholders that makes it a very low float stock. Already buying pressure from retail is obvious. Already many tutes have positions with big names among them   Add all of the above to the equation and lets see... The stock already hit 18+ back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20% short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50% of its value. Now shares remaining are very low because  Dont forget Monday $BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above. This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering.     I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search. All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer.  Some people say $BODY to 0, 5, 20, 30, 50, 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float     Big thanks for taking some parts from the DD of Traditional-Studio-5 and some other BB followers. Any mistake i may not have seen please contact me to fix it asap since i double checked. Sorry for any typos also. Enjoy your investing journey!"

I stated a couple weeks ago that I was going to do one on Zillow.  I was able to stop shit posting just long enough to give this a try. I will include some numbers and links to most everything I lay out in this post, but much of will be anecdotal along with just how much I personally think of the company overall and how I use it. I am not a TA guy personally but do like trends. $Z is ubiquitous to real estate (RE) as is $GOOG to search and $ZM for video conferencing.  It has grown and become a part of pop culture  The first disruption I will cover is $Z Property Manager.  From my own personal experience, it is the greatest thing to come along.  I have moved houses in the same city 6 times in 10 years, was in the lake cabin market for many of those years along w having 5 rental properties.  First, the marketing alone from $Z has provided the best and most quality applicants for the rental units.  $Z simultaneously puts your property on $Z, Trulia, and Hot Spots.  Craigslist is nonexistent in this space now (at least in my area) and while $FB marketplace is decent; it does not come close to competing w $Z.  Last 8 tenants have all come from $Z marketing.  It does not stop there either.  Once you get an applicant $Z rental manager allows you take applications, accept applications, and once accepted set up all payments electronically ‚Äì all online and seamlessly.  They will even screen applicants for public records, credit, and criminal history.  The lease process is so simple using your own documents and easily insert data, initials, and signatures wherever needed.  $Z is now charging (monetizing) the marketing of rentals and I have no doubt they will be able to do so more for all facets of the rental process and I would not blink an eye as long as it is reasonable.  Mobile app is easy to use for all parties from my experience.  Customer service has been top notch on the 3 occasions I have had any questions.  The numbers have been fantastic.  $Z acquired it‚Äôs closest competitor Trulia in 2015  $Z reported 4th Q 2/10/21 and absolute blew past any and all expectations.  My rough research had $Z moving from about $164 to $194 on this report and it had ran up nicely up to earnings.  In my opinion, it then sold off after this in the general tech sell off that started very close to this reporting date.  I wont list all the numbers here, but here they are for you to peruse  $Z Q1 2021 earnings report was another beast of a report in my opinion, especially the EPS of $.44 beating expectations by 83%  I believe in addition to what is laid out here, that $Z will disrupt how RE is transacted in the future w iBuying division  $Z share price has not been this low since Dec 2020, it looks like it has consolidated to me and ready to run and never look back.  TipRanks has an analyst price target of $172.62, an increase of 46% from current share price  Obviously, there is way more information out there and analysis then provided for in here, but I wanted to do a DD on something I believe in that isn‚Äôt mentioned on WSB much that I have seen and I believe has tremendous long term viability and growth ahead of it. Don‚Äôt ever invest based on what some dude on the internet says and I have been long in $Z for a long time and plan to only grow that position: Sold some shares over a week ago to buy a LEAPS Jan 2023 $100 strike and have 50 shares.

Here's why: Fundamentally. Technical analysis.   From this picture, we can see how the Bollinger bands are tightening up immensely, and we are about to see a triple cross of the 20/50/200 DMA. Both of these are signals of a large movement in price and if institutions are getting in so recently I couldn't imagine it's going to tank much further. This is the reason why I believe this is the signal. Call it apophenia if you aren't into TA but it can be an incredible tool for establishing share price.

I did not expect the smart questions and comments I got then, so this is Part Three (these posts started over a year ago). I will provide a summary of pros and cons from trading using this approach as I am moving to new things. It is unlikely to post about it anymore, the topic is exhausted as far as I am concerned.  This is a list of phrases to research, the best I can come up with while writing this post: option pricing option strategies dynamic hedging portfolio margin TIMS margin margin stress test risk convexity weighted vega option market makers strategies long term short term capital gains tax You also need to be comfortable with macro economics, financial analysis and valuation methods, monetary and fiscal policy, SEC/FINRA/exchange rules and goes without saying, you need to use portfolio margin.  You need to think of cash and volatility as assets. When you make a trade, you swap assets (stocks, options, futures, FOPs, indexes, cash). You can be long or short assets. Your portfolio has to be designed in such a way it is ""balanced"" at spot. Search ""delta neutral"" as a proxy to grasp the concept. Research ""long short strategy"". That should give you examples of balancing a portfolio. A lot of hedging strategies (and a market maker specifically, delta hedging) are about protecting the PnL. I look at my account from three angles:  There is no freely available opportunity to structure a trade in the public markets where all three are protected from downside risk aka ""free lunch"". In order to get value from this post you need to accept that first. You can however focus on two out of the three above, and disregard or postpone dealing with the third. My personal priority order has always been Risk, Tax Liability, PnL. As long as you don't need to realize losses or are forced into liquidation, PnL volatility can be ignored. This is easier said than done - you need mental game and conviction to handle the drawdowns. In summary, to achieve high leverage and low risk while chasing convex returns you will experience stress and delayed gratification. This is the price.  You must do fundamental research (analysis) and identify assets that have relatively high share price, are marginable, experience high volatility and have a deep, liquid option chain available for you to trade. It is essential that you choose something with a hard floor on value (NAV > zero from an accounting point of view). Examples: $SPY, $TSLA, $SQ, $GOOG, $FB, $MRNA etc. An options straddle (buy a call and a put contract with the same strike and expiration) is the simplest example of a positive convexity risk profile. You can use the put/call parity formula C - P = S - K to define a convex trade including long and short options across the term plus a position in the underlying. For extra benefit, you can try to define the options structure in such a way it's net credit (you collect more premium from short legs expiring worthless than you pay for the long legs). The long/short aspect of the portfolio comes from exploring the concept of being long the underlying and short the same using options (synthetic short, risk reversal, ratios etc). Since you are not focused on delta hedging (being market neutral) at all times, the profit comes from having a view on the underlying direction (for example delta positive for a bull view). The leverage is the result of managing risk. Think of finance as the ""art of pricing risk"". When you add a position to your portfolio margin, it will increase you collateral requirements if you take on more risk or decrease them if you achieve the opposite. Leverage is just a number - the ratio between the gross position value and the net liquidation value in mark-to-market terms of your positions. One dollar of liquidation value in assets can in my case controls almost 30 dollars of market exposure (long+short). If you got this far you should have understood already that this leverage is not linear. Nor are your potential returns if the position has positive convexity like I am showing you below from my account (screenshots from my Interactive Brokers TWS interface and the FundSeeder connected account).  You can use this approach to build a bigger position that you would normally control in the market. The dynamic adjustment (hedging), cost of transactions and time commitment plus the margin cost (I am paying approximately 22bps above the 10Y treasury note rate at the time of writing) must be factored in. You have a certain amount of delta hedging around spot...but as the account becomes larger and more complex, the tradeoff between the three components mentioned above is more obvious. There will be move volatility in your PnL than in your underlyings, at times. This is actually a  If any of the underlyings you have exposure to moves aggressively up or down, you profit from it more than 1% for each 100bps move (convexity). If it trades sideway, you should be able to get a some net credit from your premium writing.  Any trading strategy works until it doesn't. For example if rates go up, or volatility across the market goes down, this loses its effectiveness and operators have to adapt or experience low performance or losses. A position using both stock and options which capture different levels of implied volatility across the term has to be entered over time. Liquidating the account, extricating yourself from the daily management can be a complex project with unmitigated risks (if market moves aggressively while unwinding positions). Same applies to margin calls - while the broker usually does a stellar job trimming down your positions to bring the risk down, it does not have the mandate to open new contracts. Letting them run unsupervised in a high leverage setup can mean dealing with a small crisis now in the wrong way can set the scene for a massive blowout at the next one, maybe in the next minute. The skill, time and mental game requirements make any succession planning difficult. Finding a buddy to take over for you can lead some to posting at length on public forums.  The charts are speaking for themselves. High NLV volatility, massive recent drawdown (but no realized losses). If trading tech (I call them controversial) stocks like me, it's worth putting the past couple of weeks in context. The broad index is fine. All the high beta tech stuff that has no multiple support is getting wrecked. Hedge Funds long, retail long, ARKK long. Mix of unwinds and shorts pressing coupled with exogenous factors like Prime Brokers tightening control after the Archegos disaster are just amplifying the noise. Fiscal and monetary policy is accommodating, but the new tax policy will have an impact on high risk assets even if not enacted. Fed and Treasury working well, pay attention to what they do not what they say (Daily Treasury Statement, FRED, H.8). Reopening the economy is the current theme. The supply chain disruption playing on the front month of commodity futures prices is expected, but you want to apply critical thinking when you hear the argument for ""inflation"". Another phrase to google and do deep research on. Mainstream media is not the ideal place to get financial education. This is it.. written in a single go... I'm not selling a strategy, I am not an educator, I am sharing because explaining things, scrutinizing the HOW and WHY are the best ways I know to invite critical thinking and overcome your blind spots. Massively thankful to WSB and Reddit for giving me the chance to meet some amazing people and learn so much along the way.     "

Now imagine how much a cheeseburger or an IPhone would cost in that world. It wouldn't be difficult to imagine a $20 McDonald's burger or $8,000 IPhone. Of course, wages would also be much higher in this world, since there would be a much higher demand for US labor. By visualizing this, you can begin to understand that the impact of our monetary policy over the past 40 years has been   US unskilled labor wages actually decreased since 1970  The problem with the trends outlined above is that the deflationary trends have already reached their near-maximal levels.

/*# sourceMappingURL=https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/chunkCSS/UserAchievementFlair.c061794f2bc16d47b471_.css.map*/ All of this together means that the United States can no longer mask its inflationary monetary policies with deflationary trade and immigration policies. Now, enter the pandemic. The massive monetary and fiscal stimulus employed by the US government in 2020 and 2021 greatly increased the number of dollars in circulation, but added nothing to the productive capacity of the United States. The average productivity of a US worker has not grown substantially from 2019 levels. Yet in that time, the S&P 500 has gained 50% in value. A glut of money has flooded the system, leading to the ""everything bubble."" In addition, the US government owes ~$27T, and thus has a  Inflation is coming.  First, understand that while the Fed wants you to believe inflation will be temporary, in actuality, inflation is a self-perpetuating cycle. Investors see that the US dollar is losing purchasing power, so they dump the US dollar in favor of physical assets and foreign currencies. This further devalues the US dollar, causing even more fear amongst investors, leading even more people to dump the US dollar for physical assets and foreign currencies. This is why the Fed worries so much about ""inflation expectations."" As long as no one believes inflation is here (it is), the system won't spiral out of control. Unfortunately, in a free market, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool everyone forever. Now, personally, I do not believe we will see true hyperinflation (defined as prices rising more than 50% month-to-month). Instead, I believe we'll see what I'll call ""runaway inflation."" This is a return to the  In such an environment, we should expect to see a few things:  By keeping real rates low, the Fed ensures that the US government remains solvent. Stock market P/E ratios will compress, since higher nominal rates will increase the discount rate used to value future cash flows. Here's a list of some assets ranked by how they would likely perform in such a situation, from worst to best:  For the rest of this section, I will focus on gold for three reasons:   Gold increased in value by   Gold price during the 1970's Adjusted for inflation, this is still an increase of   The problem with gold is that, since it is not an asset that generates cash flows, it's difficult for people to agree on how to value it. There are essentially 3 different ways to value gold:  In the analysis below, keep in mind that in 1980, one troy ounce of gold was worth   Since 1980, commodity prices have risen by   PPI for all commodities If gold rose by the same percentage, this would imply a current price of   Gold is more than just a commodity. It's an established asset class that has been in use for thousands of years. How should we value an asset class? Well, investors tend to allocate a fixed percentage of their portfolio to a given asset class. For example, investors nearing retirement will typically allocate their portfolio 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds, and will rebalance this portfolio when stocks or bonds change in price. What percentage should we expect investors to allocate to gold if inflation returns in the coming years? In the middle ages, gold and silver represented essentially the entirety of the world's financial assets. In modern times, however, before the removal of the gold standard, gold seems to have constituted about 5% of the value of the world's financial assets. In fact, this was remarkably stable up until 1960:  Gold as percentage of global financial assets, from 1960-2015 We can see that, despite the world coming off the gold standard in 1980, gold remained 2.5% of global financial assets by 1980. After 1980, low inflation rates convinced investors that fiat currency was viable, and pushed gold down to a low of only 0.2% of financial assets during the dot-com bubble. I believe that, if and when runaway inflation rears its ugly head again, prudent investors will allocate 5%-10% of their portfolio to pure inflation hedges, such as commodities and precious metals. I believe it's reasonable to assume that of this, 2.5% of the portfolio will be allocated to gold, as it was in the 1980's. If everyone allocated, on average, 2.5% of their portfolio to gold, the price of gold would jump to  Thus, valuing gold as an asset class, and assuming an allocation percentage that is half of the pre-fiat-currency historical average, we could expect a   The third and final way to think about gold's value is as an alternative currency to the US dollar. Gold has historically been held by central banks as a universal currency, to protect these banks against exchange rate risks. In order to value gold as an alternative currency, I will look at how many dollars there were in the past, how many ounces of gold there were in the past, and then assume that there should be a fixed ratio between the total value of all US dollars and the total value of all ounces of gold over time. There are currently  Today, there are  In 1930, there were thus  In 1930, gold was worth $20.69 per troy ounce. Using the ratio derived above, today, gold should be worth: $20.69 * 194.85 =   Now that we've seen that gold is potentially massively undervalued by historical standards, the question becomes, how can we maximally profit from this information? After all, we don't just want to preserve purchasing power, we want to actually create wealth. Luckily, we have access to something today that medieval peasants did not: call options on gold, priced in nominal dollars. Since call options are priced in nominal dollars, runaway inflation makes nearly all call options appear desirable. This is especially true of an asset with low implied volatility, such as gold. For the purpose of the rest of this section, I will be examining  I've chosen gold and   To figure out what we could expect to make from $GLD LEAPs, let's summarize the results of our three ways to value gold analyzed above, assuming additionally a 10% annual inflation rate for the next two years and using that assumption to predict Jan 2023 $GLD prices:    Using an options profit calculator      It's possible to not only survive runaway inflation, but to profit massively. If gold ends up being valued the way it was historically, as an asset class or a currency, there's a potential for a  "
113,2021-04-29 22:54:05.847611,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,787.0,u/UnfazedSynergy,Quick TA DD on CLOV as of 4/29/21,"Hello my fellow apes, I have been a long-time lurker of this sub ever since I joined, but today I have decided to bring you a TA DD as of 4/29/21 price action for CLOV. As of 4/29/21, CLOV opened at $11.22 and closed at $10.17 with previous closing price of $10.50 (-3.14%). Clearly, our positive momentum was beat down hard yesterday. This was most likely due to two possible reasons:    Daily chart of CLOV  Looking at the chart above, Fibonacci retracements clearly show that we failed to cross over the 38.2% resistance level of $11.14 due to the reasons described from the previous paragraph. The 38.2% resistance level will be crucial heading into today's trading session (4/30/21) as crossing over the resistance level would mean we have a high possibility of testing the next resistance level of 50% at $12.34. If we continue a downward trend today (4/30/21) and go below the support line of $9.65, the 23.6% level will be shifted from being our support to a new resistance level. And of course, that's not a good sign since it would signify that there's a chance for us to reach back to the next support level of $8.53. Based on the historical trend, CLOV has been consolidating at around $8.53 and have been using $8.53 as a major support to bounce off so if this downward trend continues to spiral down, I would expect to see a bounce at $8.53 mark and rally back up.   Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, with yesterday's candle, it seems like we are heading into wave 2 which is a corrective wave. Today's price action will confirm whether we are officially heading towards a wave 2 or not. If today's price action confirms that we are in wave 2, I do NOT expect to see CLOV dipping further than $8.53 based on the explanation provided from the Fibonacci section and expect to see a bounce and reversal pattern to wave 3. In contrast, if today's price action shows a positive momentum, this will be a bear trap which means shorts will get fucked even more. With wave 3, I expect us to smash past 61.8% resistance level and face a major resistance test at $15.77 area. Wave 3 will be a key area for us to see how far our upside really is, but just know that if we smash past the resistance at $15.77, we will be able to test for 52-wk ATH price of $17.45 again. And if we cross over the 52-wk ATH price, sky is the limit for us and we are all going to the moon. As for the other waves (wave 4 and wave 5), expect to see an eventual healthy pullback from wave 3 and literally launch off to the fucking Mars by wave 5. I'm going to guess that wave 5 will most likely occur after the Q1 Earnings which is May 17th. That would mean that we will see wave 2 and wave 4 happen within the next 2 weeks. So, expect our journey to the moon to be a bumpy ride but know that the chart is absolutely bullish for the take off.      Yesterday (4/29)'s RSI   Daily MACD chart  All this speculation is contingent upon continuous increase in the volume level and buying pressure. Expect a bumpy ride, but based on my TA, we are primed to launch off hard. So, go tell your mom, your dad, your family relatives, and your friends to buy CLOV and hold instead of becoming paper hands and panic sell because if we hold, we are all going to the fucking moon.  P.S. Please let me know if you guys liked my TA and I might regularly post a TA DD on this sub! *EDIT 1: I forgot to say that this is not a financial advice. This TA DD is purely based on speculation and has many contingent factors in order for the speculation to be held true. Please invest into the stock at your own risk. I'm a fellow ape who just wants to see tendies for myself and for everyone else."

Split would add jet fuel. DD below.,"Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart heading into their earnings today. Been in a channel for 8 months. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. I bought calls before the split rumor so that would just icing on the cake. Anyone who thinks mega cap companies can't break out look at FB, up 7% today. I follow lots of hedge fund guys on Twitter and they're all sharing the same article of this hedge fund guy Bill Miller saying AMZN will double in Barron's and they're all just waiting for a reason to send it higher.  If there's an earnings beat then over the next few weeks analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's which'll also send it higher. Analysts don't downgrade AMZN. They either keep their previous ratings or they upgrade.  If we get any kind of good news Thursday AMZN will have $4k+ upside in the next month. $5k upside in the next 2 months. I've done a lot of time doing DD on this and I think it's a rate 5-star situation so I wanted to bring it to the fam. ü¶ç Haven't pitched an idea here before cuz this is the first really 5 star risk/reward bet I've found. I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or üöÄüåï. As for the Split rumor, if it's true it would be huge.  If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% tomorrow even on average earnings. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months.  A split isn't needed at all though for a break out.  The last thing that needed to fall into place was yield expectations for the next month and Powell's meeting yesterday should help in that regard. I'm thinking   "

If you believe in people's right to privacy, or simply don't think one corp should have a monopoly on everyone's private information.    But as I discussed above facebook can only monetize  So how long until facebook users collectively flood them with worthless engagement to deliberately destroy their business?  People just have to make it clear ""if you do business with facebook, you won't get your money's worth"" It's my opinion that facebook is a house of cards, just waiting for a light breeze to knock it down to book value.  Since this is obviously an activist stance of sorts, I‚Äôll clearly state how I interpret the ethics of this situation, and why it is ‚Äúfair game‚Äù.  People often judge other‚Äôs actions either by their motives, the means they used, or the consequence. Consequence can only be determined after the fact, but to be safe I will cover both motive and means. For one, this isn't me doing it. I am stating a possibility, and if others do it, that is the real cause, because my sharing this risk does not guarantee it comes to fruition.  The Motives   a. Trying to manipulate people‚Äôs behavior without telling them how, I believe to be the equivalent of running a mass psychological experiment with zero informed consent. This goes against so many ethical guidelines, and just because it‚Äôs a AI playing with people‚Äôs psychology instead of human‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make it any better. b. To scare off advertisers all you have to do is make them think everyone is clicking. If facebook didn‚Äôt want us to engage with every single ad, they shouldn‚Äôt have done such a good job designing it for that exact purpose‚Ä¶  2. Monopolizing private information and internet speech a. They have no consistency an due process in an industry that really is many people‚Äôs only chance to have a voice. b. if some viral trend gets people to do this, they are effectively voting Facebook out of business with each click. By design, this only works if the users collectively hit back. c. They clearly conned everyone into giving up a valuable resource for free(all your data)‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt have to give them a permanent monopoly on it. They are tracking you. You can misdirect their trackers‚Ä¶ so game on  The Means  a. This isn‚Äôt just a legal thing, it‚Äôs strategic. Facebook can tell if you use bots to click every ad and they will ban and that gets the person doing it in trouble b. However their whole site is designed to get people to engage with ads. So average people‚Ä¶they can‚Äôt do anything if they choose to click every ad and by nothing 2. It‚Äôs democratic a. I said above this only works if already active users start flooding them with worthless engagement b. if some viral trend gets people to do this, they are effectively voting Facebook out of business with each click. By design, this only works if the users collectively hit back. 3. It‚Äôs exactly what their whole platform is designed to make you do‚Ä¶engage with ads. If it can't handle exactly what it was manipulating us to do, that's on them. a. Totally self explanatory b. Literally the entire platform exists to make users click on ads‚Ä¶so if clicking on ads to much can cause advertisers to lose value and leave, that‚Äôs on them‚Ä¶users were just doing what Facebook tried to manipulate them into doing Now that I've explained why I see both the motive and means as ethical, I see no reason why people won't engage in such a form of protest. It's easy and it make's sense.  Disclosure - I've been weighing into puts. I'll be shifting positions going into this trade over the next couple days/weeks.

JC at last conference call said he's in discussion to sell ""MOST"" of the patents...that equates to minimum of 20,000 patents.  We know that messaging and phone hardware patents are critical to following companies (google, fb, snap, twitter, apple, etc). We also know 2,000 companies are infringing on blackberry patents (  So 20,000 patents at say lower end of average of $500,000 is  I think the patent porfolio will go between $12-$15 billion.   50 million share shorted of 250million retail float...we will hit $75 within few months of patent sale!!!

An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!  The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, ‚Äúbiggest competitor.‚Äù Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, ‚ÄúTechnology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we‚Äôre here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.‚Äù Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open. Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release. Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the ‚Äúdouble-Irish,‚Äù loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it‚Äôs passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits. The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA. JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world‚Äôs largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe‚Äôs leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open. A relatively low amount of major economic numbers will be released this week.

149,2021-04-29 22:55:51.138881,META,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,178.0,u/CSMATHENGR,Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary: Bayesian Statistics,"Took a lot of adderall and read the jim cramer post as soon as it started to hit. Just wasted a few hours of my day writing this. I have shit to do  A famous argument for why Financial Analysts/Traders/Stock pushers are frauds or don‚Äôt know what they are doing is that they are barely correct out perform a coin flip in terms of the ratio of correct predictions on total predictions. While I do (most of the time) stand in the same camp of believing most analysts/stock pushers are frauds/don‚Äôt know what they are doing(at least the ones who have public followings), I don‚Äôt think this is a fair calculus or argument. I will explain why.  First off we need to define what I mean when I say Binariness. In this scenario, meta analyses will determine a prediction by being Right or Wrong by some determining metric. This metric most of the time will have some sort of dependency on time and a uniform timeframe for all the predictions(  So first off I want to clarify that predictionsCorrect/predictionsTotal is the correct calculus, but the way we quantify each variable is wrong. This section will clarify the steps need to quantify WRONG predictions CORRECTLY. Let‚Äôs assume an analyst deemed a prediction wrong, lets analyze their decision.  Let‚Äôs say(lots of assumptions but it is important to get the point across) that we have a prediction that says ‚ÄúStock x will go from $15 to  $30 by next year because of good earnings. ‚Äù and by t2 stock x is $21. The stock price obviously did not meet the price prediction but why not? Did x have good earnings? Did they have bad earnings? In both of these specific scenarios, the predictor SHOULD be wrong. They might have been right about having good earnings but they were not right with the price prediction(so only ¬Ω legs were met). If they had bad earnings then this was a direct contradiction of the prediction(0/2 legs were met).  Elaborating on the above example‚Äôs outcome where ¬Ω legs were met, it is important to variables, outcomes, and sensitivities that their thesis can be impacted by. In either of these cases, the predictor deserves to be wrong.  But what happens if an event happens that NOBODY could have predicted given the available data? Now defining something to be a black swan event can be pretty subjective at times. For example, a TSLA bear might not define the event when Elon Musk broke the Cyber Trucks window causing the stock price to fall as a Black Swan Event because they probably hold the thesis that their cars are shit and that their prices targets priced this in. A TSLA bull would probably defend themselves by saying that this WAS a black swan event. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail on whether these arguments are valid or not but I want to bring light to the option of throwing the data out since it is inconclusive.  Now lets say an analyst is doing a meta analysis on another analysts predictions and like I said before, they take all their predictions and compare them for some constant t2 without respect to the predictions actual thesis. What happens if the the prediction has an underlying assumption that is either WAY before t2 or WAY after t2? Now the prediction will appear wrong(or right) but the underlying test is flawed, skewing the score. If the predictor says ‚ÄúStock x will go from $15 to $30 by t2‚Äù but the analyst is comparing this outcome to t3 where t3 != t2, now you have a bad metric.  I don‚Äôt think I need to elaborate this side of the coin as they are  mirrors of the above but obviously we need to cover all bases and want to make that explicit.  This whole essay is swimming around the idea of Bayesian Statistics, or Bayes Theorem of conditional probability: P(A|B) =P(B|A)P(A)/P(B) This says the probability of event A GIVEN that event B is true is equal to   Hopefully this made sense and hopefully you learned something. I‚Äôm not going to proof read this either because I need to go to the gym and finish my day. I got caught in writing this because I took a bunch of adderall and didn‚Äôt see where the time went. Fuck  Don‚Äôt trust all articles that say ‚Äú[Your fav analyst] is only right 50% of the time!‚Äù. Many people who try to discredit an analysts outcomes are not using the correct metric in order to determine correctness."
408,2021-06-29 23:07:06.595258,GOOGL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,390.0,u/SectorPotential2083,"Pubmatic ($PUBM) - Trade for Justice, or for Profit","Thank you to:  PUBM has been a name that has been floating around for a few weeks now, usually in the context of its high short interest. As we dug into the name further, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that this company is not dog-shit, is not failing, nor is it in a dying industry (as most of the other short interest plays that will remain unnamed), but a thriving company in an accelerating industry. This post will guide you through how we stumbled on the name, the company and its financials, the industry, the short-interest, and the plan. There are several angles of attack here, enough for everyone to get their grubby little hands dirty: traders, investors and gamblers. A summary:   Plan: Shares for the conservative players. Options - the chain is limited because options were just introduced - pound any and all strikes - with focus on the longer-dated. Disclaimer: Multiple people have contributed to this report, and most have shares in the $30 range when the idea of this play was first conceived.  What caught our interest originally, was a volume scan. After market close on 6/7, $PUBM showed up on a scanner looking for relative volume increases. This is a scan I use a lot, as it‚Äôs a good way to follow the whales as they tip their hand when scaling into a position. When you see big volume moves (over the relative average), but little price movement, it‚Äôs usually a sign of institutional accumulation. The big players piece into positions slowly as not to price themselves out with a massive market order. In the case of $PUBM, despite a 3x volume spike, price only increased a modest 5%. These moves are often signs of trend reversals when an institution slams its wizard staff into the ground and says, ‚ÄúYou shall not pass!‚Äù. The last three weeks have seen the most shares traded in $PUBM‚Äôs history - even more than when $PUBM IPO‚Äôd in December of 2020. In addition to accumulation volume, the PUBM chart is a perfect example of both types of head and shoulder patterns (topping H & S, and bottoming inverse H & S) - see Chart 1. The original H & S called out the top, and now we see an inverse head and shoulders formed, which is typically a signal of a bottoming, reversal pattern. The breakout was rejected at the original ‚Äúneckline‚Äù of the topping pattern, and retested the breakout point on 7/2/21 - and has held. This is the beginning of a text-book trend-reversal breakout. The chart setup is a buy.  But what is it we‚Äôre buying?    In short, Pubmatic is an advertising technology company. For most of human history, business owners have been using ads to sell their products, inform their customers of a value proposition, or build brands. With the advent of the internet, ‚Äúadtech‚Äù companies like Google have grown rich and powerful by allowing advertisers to communicate with any type of customer they want, virtually instantaneously, as much as they want. No other form of advertising offers these features and as such, the digital advertising market has become  Figure 1 - Digital ad spending worldwide   Pubmatic operates and competes in this space, specifically programmatic advertising. Before programmatic, digital ads were bought and sold by teams of people on either side of the equation, which was slow and cumbersome. Now there are scores of companies that have built software and infrastructure that allows digital ad space to be traded programmatically. The market share of programmatic advertising as part of all digital advertising has been on the rise (figure 2): Figure 2 - market share of programmatic advertising   Since Pubmatic is a programmatic ad company ‚Äì it is benefiting from these two tailwinds: more ads are becoming digital and more digital ads are becoming programmatic. Programmatic channels primarily have two sides to them: the buy side and the sell side. At a basic level, publishers generate revenue by selling digital ad space on their content, and advertisers/marketing agencies will purchase this ad space to place an ad in front of a potential customer. Pubmatic is an SSP or supply side platform. Publishers will integrate and configure Pubmatic‚Äôs software to allow for the transactions to take place. Publishers want the best outcomes possible for their ad slots, so more often than not, they‚Äôll integrate with multiple SSPs in an effort to increase their overall yield. I can‚Äôt stress this enough: the programmatic ad market is so complex, I would be willing to bet that a single person couldn‚Äôt wrap their head around the whole thing. It is mountainous in size.  Needless to say, most digital channels continued to grow as people spent more time inside and on their devices. Pubmatic‚Äôs revenue continued to grow YoY as overall advertising spend took a big hit (due to COVID). The most exciting part about this is that global ad spend is projected to return to its normal growth pattern ‚Äì you can see this already taking place in figure 3. Figure 3 - Global Advertising Forecast   So not only did Pubmatic gain a greater share of the total advertising dollars in 2020, the overall advertising pie is going to grow as well. This rebound in ad spend is yet another tailwind for Pubmatic. If you‚Äôre keeping count ‚Äì that makes three so far:   Since short interest is what all the kids talk about these days, that was where we headed to next. In addition to looking at squeeze probability, it is good to know if a company is highly shorted. Most short-sellers know their stuff (except maybe Melvin), and if a company is highly shorted, it‚Äôs usually for a reason. $PUBM has short interest that is estimated as high as 50% in some places. We actually believe this to be an inflation due to a quirk in the public float involving share types, which the aggregators such as Bloomberg and others haven‚Äôt caught on to yet (will explain later). There is a chance we are incorrect about this, but according to our calculations, the short interest is closer to the 20% mark - which of course, is still very high. Price peaked at $77 during the first week in March, and shorts have hammered it ever since. The question is, why?  Like most newly IPO‚Äôd companies, there was an insider share lockup. These insider shares were mostly of the class B variety; these were shares awarded to VC firms and investors that have been with the company since its inception in 2008. PUBM announced during the Spring that those insiders with class B shares (of which there are 40+ million of), were free to sell as of 6/1. While we don‚Äôt know if this is what short-sellers had in mind, it is probably a safe bet. A similar situation happened to PLTR a few months back when they had their own insider lockup expiration. So the next question is‚Ä¶  Some did, but not many. It is estimated that roughly 4-6M class B insider shares have been sold - only one firm has liquidated, the other big players are still in. Why are they still in the game? $PUBM has an interesting quirk in their share and voting structure where class B shareholders hold a 10:1 voting advantage over the class A (public float) holders. Their one class B share gets 10 votes per share, vs our 1 vote per class A share. If you want to still retain voting power within the company, you really do not want to sell your class B shares. Furthermore, if class B shareholders sell, it consolidates the voting power of the remaining class B shareholders. Why this is important is because everytime a class B share is sold, it converts to a class A public share; this is what is missing when everyone talks about the short interest. Some of these class B holders have sold, converting their shares into class A and thus increasing the public float, and diluting the short interest. However, most insiders have held - and will most likely continue to hold if they still want a voting stake within the company. Worth noting is that two of the biggest holders, VC firms Nexus India Capital and August Capital, both have seats on the Board of Directors - so it is unlikely that they will sell a meaningful amount any time soon. So the lockup has come and gone without too much damage - share price bottomed out and has now increased. Why else would someone be short?  Consumer data has been called the oil of our generation. All of the data that is generated on your devices is sold, recorded, and analyzed. Companies do this in order to serve you targeted ads based on your spending habits and characteristics. In the past, all of this has been done without the full knowledge or consent of the end user (you). Once people started to realize just how far the tracking had gone, governments and individuals started to demand better privacy from adtech companies. Apple has been leading this effort across the board since privacy has become part of their brand image. Agencies and advertisers have become drunk off of readily available third party consumer data and as the privacy wave makes its way across the world, we‚Äôre going to see less third party data available to advertisers. Last year, Google said they would start phasing out browsers from accepting the third-party cookies that help advertisers, publishers and data brokers profile you to help advertisers target ads toward you. The change would prevent an adtech company  (PUBM) that recorded your visit to a trading website from later showing you ads for that stupid day trader guy with long red hair and a beard (I know you‚Äôve seen those ads before). This in effect would hinder all adtech companies from doing what they do. But this dropped two days ago (6/23)  Google delayed this cookie phasing out until 2023 so the show goes on (Leo trading gif).  The adtech industry is addressing this with the use of identifiers, typically in the form of hashed email addresses or phone numbers that are collected upfront from the end users. Pubmatic has been working vigorously on getting these identifiers put in place through the use of their identity hub product, which is identifier agnostic. There is a lot of speculation surrounding which of these identifiers will end up winning, but since Pubmatic can integrate with any of them, they don‚Äôt much care which one wins out in the end. Pubmatic‚Äôs management will need to keep a close eye on the privacy developments as they move forward, because the sunset of the third party cookie won‚Äôt be the only problem. That said, the adtech industry is notoriously finicky, and Pubmatic has been able to keep up with the times. Management has repeatedly said that they take a long term approach toward their investments, and I expect them to continue to be able to deliver value to publishers and agencies as these investments like Identity Hub pay out. While the privacy wave is a headwind, Pubmatic has been working on addressing it for years now. In aggregate, Pubmatic has a lot more going for it than against it.

/*# sourceMappingURL=https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/chunkCSS/UserAchievementFlair.c061794f2bc16d47b471_.css.map*/     I‚Äôve seen this sort of thing in the past (Etsy, Livongo, The Trade Desk for example) where a company finds its stride. This revenue growth is twice that of the larger industry, so we can assume that Pubmatic has indeed found its stride and is gaining market share. Management has echoed this sentiment. One important risk to note is that Verizon Media accounts for 20% of their total revenue (taken from their first quarter prepared remarks):   It‚Äôs good that this percentage has been coming down as they gain market share, but we‚Äôll want to keep an eye on that over time to make sure it continues to trend in the right direction. Also the partnership is growing over time - this is an example of SSP consolidation.  Pubmatic operates with a high gross margin, as you would expect from a cloud-based software company. Their gross profit has also been trending upwards, so they are gaining more efficiency as they develop. Their long term gross margin target is 70%, which has already been achieved.    What‚Äôs more, their 2020 net profit fell in line with a highly efficient cloud computing company. Wall Street analysts aren‚Äôt predicting their profitability properly. If we assume a 20% net margin on $200 million in revenue for 2021, earnings per share is going to be 81 cents based on 49 million outstanding. Current estimates are only showing a high estimate of 38 cents per share, much lower than what should be achievable for Pubmatic. They‚Äôve already handily beat earnings for Q1 so they are well on their way toward the ~80 cents figure. If they can hit these numbers,     Pubmatic is a highly profitable company, in a growth industry, that is stealing market share, and has     We don‚Äôt know why anyone would be short this company. Maybe there is something under the hood that we are not privy to, but we only know what‚Äôs publicly available, and everything looks really clean. I suspect shorts are closing - there‚Äôs no reason not to. But the beauty of this potential play is you can attack this from multiple angles. Want to play the short squeeze? Go ahead - it‚Äôs a possibility. Want to play the value investor? That works too - Pubmatic is undervalued compared to its peers. How about growth? The digital advertising industry is accelerating, and PUBM is still trading at levels below its valuation.  How about a market mechanics liquidity play (see the bonus section)? Want to play the chart? Easy reversal pattern and ride that trend with the accompanying volume. Bottom line is, most trading opportunities offer one or two avenues for profitability - PUBM has lots of different pathways for success - pick a path that suits your risk tolerance and hope the market doesn‚Äôt shit itself. A wise trader once told me, ‚ÄúYou can either trade for justice, or for profit, but not both‚Äù. Pubmatic may just offer the rare opportunity to trade for both.  Shares and the limited calls are what‚Äôs recommended for now. As some of you may have noticed, PUBM did not have an options chain up until 6/25. Some limited strike prices have been added, but still not enough. Pound ‚Äòem and make our friendly brokerages add more. PUBM managed to get to $77 without the aid of options leverage so I see no reason why a revisit of that price is unattainable by summer‚Äôs end with the company and industry tailwinds. Considering that any case for shorting PUBM has been removed, it appears a new trend is starting. Where things may get a little spicy is in the bonus section - and it is in regards to the restricted liquidity.  The liquidity for PUBM is very, very tight. If you‚Äôve been watching the intraday movements at all, you‚Äôll notice a barren orderbook, with share bid/ask spreads routinely above $.50, and sometimes even in the dollar range. Exacerbating the already restricted float is the high institutional ownership - which currently sits at 74%. With most of the shares sitting in the coffers of big players, there aren‚Äôt many shares exchanging hands on a day-to-day basis - which makes for wild price swings.  What makes this interesting is that as mentioned in the paragraph above - options were just introduced as of 2 weeks ago. This is very unusual for a $1.5B market cap company that has been traded for over 6 months. Only minimal strike prices and dates have been added thus far, with more additions anticipated. The more strikes that get added, and the more OTM call bombs that people lob PUBM‚Äôs way, the more interesting and volatile things can get. I say again, PUBM accelerated into the 70‚Äôs after IPO, without the aid of options dynamite. With the company and industry headwinds dulled for now, sprinkle in the FD leverage and anyone short should probably pack up their bag, cash in their tickets, and GTFO. Trade responsibly and good luck!   "

I‚Äôve done a couple DDs on the company, and A LOT has happened since my last DD. They‚Äôve had their first earnings report. They‚Äôve announced the construction of new farms. They‚Äôve started expanding into other crops besides just tomatoes. And most importantly, which I will get to, they acquired a robotics company called Root.AI and will leverage their experience to build  I firmly believe in the mission of $APPH and there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that $APPH will take me (and possibly you) to the promised land. üåïüåïüåïüåï Quick Overview Of $APPH $APPH is one of the few publicly traded indoor farming companies in the world. To borrow some big words from  Honestly, there‚Äôs so much to talk about this company and industry, I will probably have to produce a FAQ one day if there‚Äôs enough interest. However, what I want to focus on with this DD, is, well what‚Äôs new? What‚Äôs New With $APPH? Since my last DD, the following has occurred.  Root.AI and Project TalOS   What is Project TalOS In April of this year, Appharvest bought Root.AI which is an artificial intelligence and robotics company. This acquisition enhanced $APPH‚Äôs ability to monitor crop growth using algorithms and pick crops using robots. While this in itself is pretty cool, (having say Jarvis pick your tomatoes when they are ripe) from a üí∞üí∞üí∞ standpoint it is just ok. (Btw their robot now is called Virgo not Jarvis in case you were curious.) Sure you reduce some costs but that‚Äôs about it and as of now, $APPH has no plans to manufacture and sell these robots. Now, I‚Äôm not an expert of the food industry, but I‚Äôd imagine most of the industry is low margin, meaning you aren‚Äôt making a ton of money from each sale. You just hope to make a lot of sales. This is similar to another industry with a company I follow, Carvana, a used car dealer. Buying and selling used cars is a low margin business, so there needs to be additional revenue streams if you truly want to make it big. Turns out, the bulk of the money Carvana makes comes from financing as well as from selling additional products like GAP insurance, NOT from flipping cars. The leadership at $APPH probably realizes this as well. They can‚Äôt be an agg-tech company if all they do is sell crops. Sure, $APPH has goals to become the largest CEA in the US, but these guys have even bigger dreams. They, like Carvana, plan on creating additional revenue streams, which could turn what is traditionally a low margin business into a high margin one. One additional revenue stream they are looking into is creating the industry standard Operating System of the CEA world. (Think Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, type stuff‚Ä¶ but for Aggtech) As of now, there currently is no good OS for running CEAs, which is what led $APPH to create its own OS called Project TalOS. The vision is for this software to integrate robotics, genetics, management software, and AI. In other words, they plan to create the software that oversees and optimizes production through controlling every aspect of crop growth.   So is there a market for this? I‚Äôm no smarty, but the answer is DUH!!! I‚Äôm willing to bet that more and more crop production will be moved indoors. Additionally, don‚Äôt forget about the recent boom in marijuana, which will require some sort of software to manage their crops. Also, there have been other indoor farming companies popping up here/there. For example, a competitor of $APPH, Aerofarms, is looking to build a farm in the Middle East. In door farming is the future, and as these farms get more sophisticated, at some point they need some lines of code to make everything work together.  With that said, do I believe that the OS developed by $APPH will be able to be the dominant OS in the CEA space? I can‚Äôt say for certain, given that it‚Äôs such a new thing and in a growing industry. But the fact that they are attempting to do so and given their past track record of execution gives me confidence that they will at the very least make very good progress. Remember, these guys were able to build their first farm in 2020 during the heights of Covid-19 and are on-track to build out a total of 12 farms by 2025. $APPH also always seems to be ahead of the curve, like locking in glass and steel prices before the current inflation. While other companies are just beginning to build farms, these guys are already building the operating system that those farms will use. I love $APPH. I hope to see yall there with me. üôèüôè  Also, DM or comment for sources.  Seems like posts get removed if they have links."

About SHEN  SHEN has few major streams of revenue:  I won't go deep into the all of these streams, briefly what you need to know is that the Company has sold their wireless asset sale to T-Mobile US and is focusing more on their broadband infrastructure, further expanding their main source of revenue. Fundamentals  Remember reading  In the times when everything is priced in several years ahead, it's really hard to find a company with solid fundamentals, that is still going under the radar.  For a company in oversaturated market such as Telecommunications and controlled by giants such as T-Mobile, Verizon, Viacom, to keep such a great fundamentals is nothing but amazing. How did they achieve it ? Simple, while everyone was trying to dominate big cities and get the main piece of cake, SHEN was focusing on expanding their influence in the rural areas. Yes, internet, exists, outside of the metropolis and even the folk in the country side want to be online so they can eat some popcorn watching you lose your life savings on AMC puts. Let's sum up why these fundamentals are a good sign of a healthy company. Anything with P/E under 20 is almost a unicorn nowadays, everything is being priced in several years ahead and on potential that might not be there yet, while SHEN goes under the radar this entire time. In Short, SHEN does better in fundamentals than most of the Industry respective to the company size. What this all mean ? In the most simplistic way, with 52 Week 38.77-57.65 you can be certain that the company is not going away anytime soon, they have been around for more than 100 years, they are slowly expanding, sure it's not Google, it's not T-Mobile, but they are keeping it lowkey in the rural areas where there is still plenty of room to expand, opposite to the big cities where you have to rival the giant companies. The company is beating expectations on quarterly basis  Seeing a lot of green, that's what I like. Regarding the potential market cap and share price targets. I believe the company just solely based on their fundamentals and stable revenue/earnings streams, could be worth much more. However, the average volume on the stock is barely 187K therefore it's been going under the radar for some time.  Even though it's only a speculation, we are living in the time where everybody wants to get rich quickly on the most notorious stocks or invest in the to known giants that took control over their respective industries. If you want something a growth stock, you can always just buy some giant company in the sector or just buy some index fund. That could be one of the reasons why it's hard to notice a company that had been around for a long time, is growing in the rural areas, expanding, closing deals and makes sure there is a stable income/revenue stream. However, that does not change the fact that the company has much more potential and could be undervalued. FREE TENDIES (SPECIAL DIVIDEND) - 18.75$ / share Now to the actual play. To be honest, I too haven't known about SHEN since this announcement, I had couple of dividend paying stocks, but this opportunity was too good to ignore. SHEN is focusing more and more on their main revenue stream - broadband and decided to sell of their Wireless assets and operations to T-Mobile in an  SHEN is giving away 936.6mil of this sale back to the shareholders. ,making it 18.75$ per share, which is insane and will be payed out on August 2nd if you are a shareholder as of recorded date July 13th ! The rest of the proceeds they used to cover all of the debt and are expected more than 19.6mil to be reinvested back to the stock, further pumping the price up. Why is it such a big deal ? If you didn't just skim through the fundamentals, you would have found out that the company's fair value is around 56$/share. What is it trading as of this moment ? 56.81$ so even despite the news of crazy special dividend, we are trading around the fair value of the company !  Yes and no, in some cases it doesn't have to, but if you enter anywhere under the 60$ in order for you to lose money on this play, the stock would have dump below their 52 week low. This is basically free guaranteed gain. You don't have speculate if Richard Branson reaches the Space or if Elon finally delivers on the self driving system. This is almost literally free win, or as it is common to say, it can't go tits up. Just the fact that 19.6 mil is expected to be reinvested back. That's 345k shares bought at the current price, almost twice as much as your average daily volume.  So even if the stock dumped right after the Dividend payout, you have guaranteed stock buybacks happening, all while the fundamentals and future outlook for the company is still holding strong.  One of the best metrics for the divi stocks is to see if the company keeps increasing the divi  https://www.marketwatch.com/story/time-to-sell-out-of-these-3-small-cap-telecom-stocks-2016-07-25?mod=mw_quote_news  Final Thoughts Special dividends does not occur that often, they are here and there and can cause massive spike in the share price in the short amount of time while. Especially if the pay out is literally almost 1/3 of the entire market cap. I believe that any entry below 60$ - 65$ / share is still amazing because in order for this to go ""tits up"", the stock would not only have to drop below it's 52 Week low (38.77), but also stay there, all in while being fairly valued at 56 Moreover, selling a big portion of their assets to T-Mobile could make the company an acquisition target. Since they are popular in rural parts of the country, acquisition of SHEN could be an easy entry for any of the telecom giants to enter rural areas. Which in turn could further skyrocket the price, but that's purely a speculation. I am planning on holding after the special dividend pay out with selling a small portion of the position on the dividend payout and holding rest for the longer term. I would like to hear any opinions on this play, any bull/bear case is very welcome. Any criticism is welcome, let me know what you think ! TL;DR Company paying out insane special dividend 18.75$/share on August 2nd if you hold shares before July 13th, while maintaining solid fundamentals.  UPDATE 1 Due to special dividend being greater than 25% of comapany's value. You would need to hold through the ex-dividend date in order to receive the dividend. Therefore you need to hold shares from 9.7.2021 through 3.8.2021 in order to receive the $18.75 special dividend. There is a 2 day settlement period for transactions. Therefore your shares have to be settled in by this Friday (9.7.) the latest in order to receive the special dividend UPDATE 2 - THE PLAY - THE TENDIES - THE FREE MONEY Givens: Since the market takes 2 days to settle. The shares need to be purchased by Friday, July 9th to be on record with the company. Due to the circumstances of this special dividend, in order to receive payment, you need to hold through the ex-dividend date which means tying up funds for a little over 3 weeks. Play: Purchase shares in multiples of 100, and buy an equal amount of puts with a $55 strike price expiring on 8/20. These currently trade for approximately $2/contract ($200 is the full value of contract). If purchased correctly your maximum downside potential is $7/share, even if the stock price falls below $53 after the ex-dividend date. However, here‚Äôs the kicker. You are entitled to the full $18.75 special dividend because you held shares during the appropriate time frame. Therefore you are guaranteed to net approximately $11.75/share which is a return of 20% with little to no risk over the course of 3 weeks."

As I type these hallowed words, I am wearing Sony XM-4s and bumping my 7 TeraByte folder of Playboi Carti leaks. Please see below my thoughts on the cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike, which trades on the Nasdaq as $CRWD. The Kaseya ransomware attack this weekend affected 17 countries and 200 businesses. Cyberattacks are growing more and more frequent. Surely you've seen the news reports. Cyberattacks are also growing more and more sophisticated, so much so that they can even infiltrate American government agencies. The $750B the Pentagon gets every year wasn't enough to prevent that. The consequences include breaches of sensitive user data and trade secrets, operational shut downs, and millions lost to paying ransoms. So, clearly, preventing these attacks is in the best interest of everyone from CEOs to Presidents to Winnie the Pooh looking ass dictators. Clearly they need to spend more. Cybersecurity products and services are going from ""nice to have"" to ""gotta get it"" status real fucking quick.  CrowdStrike is the first of its kind among cybersecurity companies. Incumbents like Palo Alto Networks, Symantec, and even FireEye (FireEye has a lot of respect in the public sector) are all Dotcom era dinosaurs. That's because CrowdStrike is a cloud-native SaaS that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent attacks. That enough buzzwords for you? Forrester, Gartner, MIT, and Google (an early investor) and many other reputable sources have called CrowdStrike leader in endpoint protection. The cloud-nativity has allowed it to strike partnerships to integrate with   According to Grand View Research, the global  I say the true opportunity is even bigger, because they haven't factored in all out cyberwar between America and the evil trinity of Russia/Iran/China. State-backed cyberattacks are nothing new. Remember North Korea and Sony back when the JamesFranco-SethRogen masterpiece  Want more proof? Just look at the  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Geopolitical tensions will of course continue to heat up. This is because humans are just a bunch of glorified, nuclear-powered apes. We will see stronger legislation mandating that businesses armor the fuck up. We will see outsized and reactionary government spending on cybersecurity. We will also likely see tax-payer funded incentives and subsidies directed toward cybsersecurity firms.  When I worked in venture capital for a summer, I realized just how important the management team is to potential investors. And CrowdStrike lives up to all expectations in this area. George Kurtz, the CEO and Co-Founder of CrowdStrike has a track record of CyberSecurity success. His startup Foundstone was acquired by McAfee in 2004, after which he worked his way up the ranks to become the CTO of McAfee. Clearly, this guy knows what the fuck he's doing. He's no sleazy salesman, he's a princely technocrat. The Chief Strategy Officer used to be the Executive Assistant Director of the FBI‚Äôs Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. I'd bet my house that this white male has many white male friends in high places. Friends who'd gladly toss him a contract or two. The rest of the C-Suite are all cyber veterans, even the CFO. It's a who's who of hacker nerds who saw the light.  Who the fuck cares. Okay fine, I care a little. Here's an overview of Q1FY22 results: Revenue increased 70% YoY, which reflects 82% growth in subscription customers. They had a net loss of $85M only because they are investing aggressively in growth and R&D. At the end of the day they have $1.7B cash on hand to weather any shitstorms. The customer relationships are deep and broad. Recurring revenue is over $1B. Furthermore, existing customers end up buying more and more products from CrowdStrike as time goes on. 64% of customers have now adopted four or more CrowdStrike products into their subscription. And it's not like companies who need to cut costs are going to get rid of their cybersecurity provider.  Why buy a shitass SPAC for upside? $CRWD is a litass business with the world at its feet.

If you‚Äôre looking for a stock with  If you‚Äôre looking for the  Desktop Metal is positioned to be a once in a generation type of company. Additive Manufacturing is a major part of Industry 4.0 that will entirely flip manufacturing on its head. Before I dive into Desktop Metal and why we all need to be bullish on this particular company, let‚Äôs briefly go back in time and take a quick history detour on how manufacturing got to where it is today and why    There are three major groups of manufacturing:  Focusing on Additive Manufacturing: The  technology for additive manufacturing started in the 1980‚Äôs and was  primarily used for prototyping. As it evolved, 3D printing transitioned  into creating molds and tools for traditional manufacturing. In the last  few decades, additive manufacturing has gone more mainstream to produce end-use parts. 3D printing is an innovative technology that lets you create a physical object from a digital model. All you need to do is make a design, transfer the file to a 3D printer, then bring your object to life. (Let's print a LAMBO!) Once printed, the 3D printer produces layers of material, one  on top of the other. This forms the finished object. So, for example,  instead of manufacturing traditional hardware, 3D printers can recreate  the same finished products by designing it on a computer and just clicking print! Think of it similar to a traditional printer but instead  of 2-dimensional, it is 3-dimensional, and can use other materials (not  just ink - it can use metal, graphite, etc.)!¬† The industry is expected to grow 11x over the next decade¬†from    History lesson is over... FF to the inception of Desktop Metal Desktop Metal was founded half a decade ago in Boston. Their initial product was to develop a metal-printing 3D printer that could be  small enough to operate within an office environment. Today, they have  four products in its portfolio: Fiber, Studio System, Shop System and  Production system. The Studio, Shop, and Production products support  both the printing of both metals as well as fiber composites such as  Carbon Fiber.¬†DM‚Äôs flagship product is their Production  system, built from the ground up to be the fastest 3D production printer  in the industry at 100x the speed of laser based systems while keeping a  consistent quality. They‚Äôve pioneered a precise and rapid process to  accomplish this speed through the following:  ._1W1pLIfaIb8rYU6YeTdAk6{margin-right:6px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK{border-radius:50%;box-sizing:border-box;height:20px;margin-left:-8px;width:20px}._1H6Meh6ZAemKxOJDOEasfK:first-child{margin-left:0}._30vlMmCcnqKnXP1t-fzm0e{display:inline-block;margin-left:-8px;position:relative}._29m-SAo1wzA0dkdfJutrjs{fill:var(--newCommunityTheme-button)}

This is where the geometry of each layer is  created and it‚Äôs repeated layer by layer.    This process is made more efficient by developing an entire box full  of parts at the same time and it‚Äôs capable of supporting multiple  stacks of parts. The next step is called cross linking. The build box is put into an oven to activate the binder and creates the parts. At this stage, the  parts are still in powdered metal form, but are strong enough to handle  and move to the next stage called depowdering and centering. This is  where the parts are put into an industrial oven and the powdered metal  is heated until it forms a solid piece of metal in the shape of the  final product itself.   Speed is only half the battle, consistency is the other half. DM‚Äôs  prints with the most advanced industrial print heads available on the  market at 1200 DPI and has a proprietary camera system that images every  layer of every bed with two different angles of light to detect defects. If any problems are encountered, it‚Äôs automatically flagged and  the operator is notified.¬† Another major advantage of DM  that was incorporated from the ground up is that it uses an open powder  system. What that means is a customer can use their own powders from  traditional supply chains directly with DM‚Äôs  production system. This open powder system means customer‚Äôs can develop a  process that works for their business and the Production system can be  adapted to fit. To make implementation even easier, DM  produced a smaller R&D machine that uses the exact same software  and steps to help businesses design a process, develop their product,  and be able to quickly transition from R&D to full production.   On top of their hardware, Desktop Metal has pioneered an  industry-leading AI-driven software for designing and modeling. This complementary SaaS product, along with secondary products like their  printing cartridges, Desktop Metal‚Äôs business model positions them well  to bring customers in and have a consistent revenue stream for years to  come.¬† Today, Desktop Metal is one of the fastest growing unicorns in US  history. Their 2020 revenue of 16.5 million USD is tiny compared to  their valuation, but their growth has been tremendous. They only began  shipping their Shop System and Production System in Q4 of 2020. Q3 of  2020 was reported at $2.5 million and rose to $8.4 million in Q4, a 236%  increase. The company‚Äôs aggressive expansion strategy positions it well  to take advantage of the growth opportunities that lie ahead. It‚Äôs  projected to be around $1 billion in revenue by 2025, a 87% CAGR. As of  now, the company has 90+ production systems on reservation, which means that they‚Äôre sold out until the first half of 2024!  Compared to their peers in the space, Desktop Metal as a stock can be  considered relatively cheap and underpriced. With no outstanding debt  and $600M+ on it‚Äôs balance sheet, there‚Äôs a wide cushion for the  business to operate over the next few years to accelerate its growth and  capture market share. This large balance sheet, something unheard of  for a company of their size, gives them an unfair competitive advantage  in the industry. This is just another one of many reasons Desktop Metal  is poised to outperform over the long term. On top of their existing suite of products, Desktop Metal has an  aggressive strategy for mergers and acquisitions. They‚Äôve already  identified $2 billion of revenue across 60+ potential targets, with 10  of them in contact and under analysis.

But you can see this is a place where we can still say fuck this short interest bullshit. And we can still find others who agree. I‚Äôm ok with conflict as long as nobody gets banned or their comments deleted. When you try to have a counter opinion on most subreddits you get insta-banned. So I‚Äôm just happy we have some freedom to talk shit here and disagree openly. It‚Äôs fun. Appreciate it you cunts. I know it won‚Äôt stop the shilling but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Let‚Äôs get some real fucking DD in here. Fuck short squeezes. It‚Äôs too easy for people to come in and manipulate this crowd on SI news. FINAL EDIT- mods flair me. What‚Äôs it take? Who‚Äôs dick I gotta suck?"

BOX,"This will not be a DD because lets be honest even the most intelligent and eloquent DD gets overlooked at times. This is more of a history lesson. Box, Inc. has been on slow and steady climb since the beginning of this year. Starting out 2021 just below $18 at 17.81 and since then it has reached highs of $27 as of today. Some of the initial spikes in spring were due to buy-out rumors, but Box squashed those and it declined slightly only to continue to rise on real growth due to the financial moves and acquisitions the company has made this year. The historical high for BOX was a handful of years ago when it teased with $29 but that was mostly on a prestigious analyst/VC mentioning them as a stock he liked long term. Then it fizzled down to the teens before hitting a COVID low in March 2020. Since that single digit price of $9 in 3/2020 it has only climbed and has become a serious threat to Amazon and Google for cloud content providers. Box has 67% of Fortune 500 companies as customers, departments of the US government, and multiple sports leagues. Like I said, it may not be a quick gainer, but the steady growth of the company is encouraging for future $$$.  FYI, I do hold over 1k shares in this stock."

Instead of investing in innovation and entrepreneurship, it is researching which stocks have heavy short interest and creating a movement to exploit this in order to create explosive growth. The technique is clear and obvious.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Now onto the classic part of this post: Every day I check a list of equities.  I don't pretend to think this is a great list or even a good list but it's my list hah I first look at Tesla (I still think it is over valued but I like to see how it tracks). I then look at Ride, NKLA, QS.  NKLA in my opinion being the trash of trash and a great example of how a bull market can keep anything afloat Lol Then I go to Pltr, Peloton, Bmbl, Door Dash, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Snowflake. Then I go to Nakd, and Fold. Then I check out some classics like Pfizer, AT&T, Coca-Cola.  I weirdly like to look at Moderna. Then I check out Endeavour Group Holdings, Coinbase, Thredup, Walkme. Then I check out Canopy. Then BB, AMC, GME. Then SLV, GLD. Then Trillium, CRISPR. Then onto the coins. Then RKT and SPCE. It is a weird routine I have each and every day almost. I think it provides a good exposure to a various class of equities sometimes by groups, sometimes by weird segments of the investing sphere. I think everything is insanely priced and way to high hah but we are in the everything bubble so that is what it is. All in all the classic narrative is that it provides me a good understanding of what is happening in the various big blocks of the investing world.  Also through google finance I get some good recommends on companies that I don't know about that maybe I will like based on that list and then I expand it sometimes. Companies like CRISPR being the things I want to invest in for a better world.  Despite that I am not touching any of this shit with a 10 foot poll based on the pricing and our current market. What equities would you add to look at and why. I'd love to know what your lists are and the reasoning you like to track those particular sets of equities and such. :) Let the shit throwing begin as I know many of you identify as apes but I still like to identify as the evolution known as human."

419,2021-06-29 23:07:40.059101,GOOGL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,31.0,u/obrien91,"Forget The Trade Desk, Buy PubMatic","PubMatic is a small-cap growth stock in the quite quickly growing adtech space, which may be facing further tailwinds from the reopening and trends such as CTV. Its valuation is lower than others in this space such as market darling The Trade Desk, while also growing faster. Large growth prospects and a reasonable valuation, combined with a low absolute market cap, provide a recipe for a successful investment. Buy potential multi-baggers while they‚Äôre small. Investment Thesis One of the core tenets of growth investing is a company‚Äôs relatively small market cap in light of a potentially large long-term opportunity. A small company with a differentiated technology or product in a large market could deliver supercharged returns if it keeps growing. This may exactly be the case with PubMatic (PUBM). The company operates an adtech platform, has a reasonable valuation, is growing fast, and has the relatively small market cap that growth investors would look for. I would contrast this stock with The Trade Desk (TTD). While they‚Äôre not exactly competitors, both operate in the adtech space. However, The Trade Desk has the opposite characteristics: while the company also reports respectable growth, it already has a much larger market cap and a high P/S valuation. Put differently, though, the investment thesis is that potentially PubMatic could replicate on the sell-side of this market what The Trade Desk has accomplished (both as a business and as double digit-bagger on the stock market) on the buy-side. Company overview As indicated, PubMatic operates in the adtech space. The company provides a sell-side cloud infrastructure platform purpose-built for digital, real-time programmatic advertising. As such, the company should benefit from general ad spend growth as well as some of the higher-growth areas in this space such as programmatic CTV (connected TV). PubMatic also expects some acceleration tailwinds from the reopening. In¬†succinct terms: PubMatic has created a sell-side ad tech platform that leverages data-driven algorithms and tools to help content publishers and app developers maximize the value of their ad inventory. The reasoning behind such an infrastructure-driven approach is that advertising is inherently data-intensive, and also real-time. Hence, PubMatic can deliver increased value (such as higher revenue for publishers and higher ROI for buyers), and also innovate faster, by controlling the full stack from hardware to software. This also results in a cost advantage. The alternative approach is using public cloud infrastructure, which only allows for controlling the software stack. PubMatic also claims it benefits from consolidation of ad budgets on fewer sell-side platforms, resulting in increased market share. This occurs through Supply Path Optimizations or SPOs. As evidence for this trend, PubMatic disclosed that revenue from those arrangements nearly doubled in Q1. Lastly, to come back to the term ‚Äúsell-side‚Äù. This can be contrasted to The Trade Desk, which is a demand-side or buy-side platform. In simple terms, the buy-side are those who buy advertising inventory, while the sell-side are those who offer ad space, anywhere on the internet. As such, the thesis really is that PubMatic may become (both as company and as a stock) on the sell-side what The Trade Desk has become on the buy-side. Q1 results In Q1, PubMatic reported $43.6M revenue, up 54% YoY. In particular, mobile and omnichannel video grew 83%, and represented 63% of total revenue. CTV grew 55% QoQ. Gross margin also increased from 65% to 72% due to increased utilization. This signals a scalable business. PubMatic‚Äôs accelerated growth over the last year is also evidenced by its increased TTM net retention, which has expanded from 112% to 130%, which is best-in-class for growth companies in general. Guidance PubMatic has guided for 33% growth for the year. While this implies a slowdown, some part of it does seem like sandbagging or conservative guidance: as discussed, the net retention was 130% in Q1, and growth in mobile and video also grew markedly faster than the overall business. Valuation PubMatic‚Äôs valuation should be considered compelling. At the stock‚Äôs current ~$40 price, the forward P/S stands at ~10x, which is over 3x cheaper than The Trade Desk. Obviously, the bullish case would be that given that both operate in the same market, PubMatic could deliver similar growth as the former, which would result in both long-term stock and valuation expansion. Although PubMatic certainly does not yet have same multi-year track record of elevated revenue growth yet as The Trade Desk, this stark difference in valuation arguably well offsets potential execution risks. At least in Q1, PubMatic was growing faster than The Trade Desk. Risks PubMatic‚Äôs growth has accelerated since COVID-19, and the company also expects continued tailwinds from the reopening, which should result in increased ad spend. However, a risk would be if growth would slow down to pre-pandemic levels; obviously, the best growth stocks, including The Trade Desk, are able to sustain elevated growth for years. Another potential risk are some of the recent and ongoing changes in the ad space, including changes in Apple‚Äôs (AAPL) policy and the phasing out of third-party cookies. However, PubMatic reports that the majority of its revenue comes from different identifiers than those two. As such, PubMatic actually views this is a competitive advantage, similar to how The Trade Desk has been¬†boasting about¬†how the Open Internet will prevail over the walled gardens. PubMatic is in fact investing in a portfolio of alternative solutions to the third-party cookie, including The Trade Desk‚Äôs UID 2.0 as well as Google‚Äôs (GOOG) (GOOGL)¬†Privacy Sandbox¬†(which includes the contested FloC). Note that The Trade Desk and PubMatic are not really competitors but rather partners, as The Trade Desk is a demand side platform. PubMatic says it is integrated with around 100 such platforms. A last risk I found was that although PubMatic especially touts its infrastructure, the company nevertheless seems to get more mixed reviews (i.e. a lower rating than TTD). This could imply it still has some way to go to truly become best-in-class. Primer on ads and cookies This section serves for those who aren‚Äôt all too up-to-date on some of the terms used here. As I would describe it, the core issues stem from privacy concerns regarding (third-party) cookies and tracking. This is leading to the phasing out of those cookies (now planned for 2023 by Chrome). However, this causes issues for the digital advertising market, which relies on targeted ads to increase their efficiency. As such, alternative, supposedly more privacy-friendly, tracking solutions are being introduced. One of the most well-known is The Trade Desk‚Äôs UID 2.0. Google, for its part, is backing on a collection of a few dozen of APIs, which it calls Privacy Sandbox. One of those is the controversial ‚ÄúFloC‚Äù, even though it does (more or less) achieve its goal to provide privacy without sacrificing targeting accuracy. Another point of dichotomy is regarding what some like to call the Open Internet vs. the walled gardens. The latter are the big ad platforms such as Google, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN). The gist is that those walled gardens have a privileged position given that they have an enormous amount of first-party data. Hence, they could survive the phasing out of third-party cookies quite unscathed. Some claim, for example, that it is in Google's interest to phase out those cookies, which could put Google at a competitive advantage as others would lose the ability to serve targeted ads. However, one might note that this dichotomy isn‚Äôt all that clear. For example, both Roku (ROKU) and Unity (U) (and likely plenty others) certainly wouldn‚Äôt be considered walled gardens among the likes of Google and Facebook. Nevertheless, both companies have said that given their own first-party data, they deem themselves to be quite unaffected by those changes in the ad landscape. Lastly, given the observation that there are so many alternative tracking solutions being developed, which may or may not conserve privacy, ultimately there may be relatively little tangible changes in the ad landscape. As such, the bottom line may be that the recent rally by the likes of The Trade Desk (due to Google‚Äôs Privacy Sandbox delay) is overblown. Investor Takeaway PubMatic offers a compelling proposition, both with its full-stack technology as well as with accelerated business results. In general, the company operates in the growing digital advertising market, and by being at the forefront with its technology and innovation, seems to be well-positioned for market share growth as well. The company has reported high growth, expanded margins, and a high 130% net retention in Q1. PubMatic is also capitalizing on the latest trends such as CTV, which grew 55% sequentially. While no stocks are risk-free, these are definitely signs that the company is able to capitalize on the growth opportunity in its adtech space. Just as importantly, compared to other growth stocks I have covered, both the company‚Äôs market cap and P/S valuation are rather low for growth stocks. That implies the risk is reduced, while the potential upside could be significant. Hence, bottom line is that PubMatic does not even have to exactly replicate The Trade Desk‚Äôs performance to deliver solid or even significant long-term investor returns. As I said about another small company a while ago,¬†Sumo Logic¬†(SUMO): buy potential multi-baggers while they‚Äôre small (and cheap)."

As many of you know due to some hedge fund tom foolery (thanks Bill Hwang) VIAC lost about half of its value. He went out in true WSB fashion, but thanks to him he have some WSB opportunities. VIAC is an old media company that has lots of appealing properties, and now has recently announced they are focusing on streaming services. In their streaming service portfolio they have Paramount+, Pluto, and Showtime with Paramount+ being their new darling garnering lots of attention. Now many have pointed out how VIAC has an extremely low P/E, great earnings reports, and more, but repeating that would be a waste of your time and mine. Read  Today I would like to point a few things out that many of us haven't noticed that are food for thought: 1.Paramount+ is doing better than many would have you believe.  Now Google Trends is no guarantee for sales, but it is a good indicator of interest. I have heard lots of slander on how Paramount+ has no good shows or how it can't compete with others in the field, but frankly I disagree. Their library is impressive if you dig into it and they are adding thousands of movies as we speak. On top of that, their ad campaigns seem like they are working and streaming has been gaining quarter over quarter for them on lesser streaming services they own like Pluto (seriously who uses Pluto). Paramount+ is gaining steam and that is going to show in the next earnings report. 2. Their Earnings Projections are underestimated  The current estimates have VIAC underperforming their last quarter. I believe there is no possible way this is the case. Their steaming revenues have vastly increased and the data coming in about their legacy cable networks indicates better than normal performance. For example, there have been reports that their ad cost per million views being higher than normal and that many of their flagship events have been going gangbusters (just see the BET awards ratings if you don't believe me). All signs are showing big revenue coming in that the analysts aren't factoring in, and I believe the earnings surprise is going to be bigger than last time. 3. The Acquisition Rumors Out of all the major media companies that could be acquired, VIAC is the most likely to happen soon. There has been a frenzie to consolidate rights in media companies and VIAC is an obvious play for many media distributors. They are relatively cheap unlike other options like ROKU (which has been frequently talked about in acquisition rumors) and so it is very likely VIAC will be picked up in the next 6-12 months in the $70-100 dollar range. Disclaimer: I have a position in this company. Here it is:  that's a lot of Tendies for a college kid like me Come on, you know you want to get on the rocket with me: "

Looking at its history, you can see the annual returns over the last five years have been great. But here‚Äôs why this particular autist really likes this stock. But first, a bit of backstory about AMD. Who is AMD and why do we care?  Next Gen Consoles Currently the latest gaming consoles are the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, both being relatively impossible to get your hands on due to the microchip shortage (more on that later).  Let that sink in. AMD has no competition for this generation of video game consoles. Every PS5 and Xbox X that gets built, AMD gets a chunk of that change. This is basically guaranteed profit for the life of the console, historically that‚Äôs about 6-7 more years. Server Hardware AMD has been expanding their server hardware lineup, and their biggest competitor Intel has dropped the ball on this one: their new server hardware isn‚Äôt rolling out til Q1 2022. Meanwhile, Google is replacing outdated hardware with AMD processors. This is a big step for AMD, because it puts them in the position of no longer being the underdog, and gives them juicy, profitable market share. CEO Lisa Su Lisa Su is an awesome woman. She has a diverse background including Texas Instruments and IBM, and since she took the reigns of AMD in 2014, the stock has soared. She helped diversify their product line success, and saw the immense benefit of getting AMD server chips licensed in China. The future of work Lots of people see the future of work moving towards a larger working from home model (anecdotal). Working from home requires hardware, and people buying hardware prefer to spend less if they can, and this is the hardware AMD specializes in. Semiconductor Shortage The massive demand for semiconductors for everything from cars to laptops to servers has been a drag on literally the entire economy. Auto manufactory lines in Midwest America are at a standstill while car lots are barren of new vehicles because of the world‚Äôs ‚Äújust in time‚Äù production model collapsing under increased demand. I personally believe this shortage is artificially holding down the price of AMD, as big money is slower to invest in a company that could potentially suffer from the shortage. Once things pick back up, there is a lot of potential for accelerated movement upwards as things become available to the public for purchase. AMD is a preferred client of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), which has invested billions into additional manufacturing capacity. Get on the train before it leaves! Once these processors start shipping out, the profits will roll in and sentiment will return.

(hop on!),"DEAR APES, A few weeks ago I began posting on AMD. At the time, the stock was trading in the mid-70's. Today, as expected, we crossed $90 price... but our trip is just getting  The deal with TESLA was announced, as well as the next AMAZING technologies in Computex, including the stacked cache for Zen3, Fidelity FX Super Resolution, the 6900 XTX Liquid Cooled, etc. There's a very simple reason why AMD will go past the MOON and MARS:  The world revolves around entertainment and in this new era, this activity is mandatory to deal with Covid-19, the lack of international travel, work from home, etc. TESLA adopting AMD for its new Model X and S is HUGE. It will take a Navi23 and an APU (two chips) per car, likely becoming an optional for all other vehicles in the future. More automobile brands will follow, as TESLA is leading the way in the industry.   TESLA selected AMD chips for its upcoming vehicles With autonomous driving, gaming in a long trip will be mandatory. But even without it, the rest of the passengers can game, either with their fellow companions or online, from their car. So, yes, the current automotive revolution will have AMD as a main supplier. Then you have consumer processing, which includes CPU's and GPU's, where AMD is dominating (mostly on the former). The Zen3 architecture is a MONSTER. Intel just cannot compete. And with the stacked cache providing up to 15% more gaming performance, that lead will continue on AMD's side. On GPU's, AMD's Navi31 is expected to be MCM (multi-chip module), aiming to repeat AMD's success with Intel, but now against NVIDIA. ""Chiplets"" allow for economies of scale to thrive. More silicon, with less defects, better binning, cheaper... it is an AMAZING IDEA. Just add cache and the latency problem can be mitigated. On console gaming, AMD is the undisputed KING. They're in the PS4, PS4 Pro, PS5, Xbox model and series X/S. Also in the Aya Neo and expected in Valve's next handheld, which will be a MONSTER. On Datacenter, AMD is groundbreaking. Epyc and the new offerings from   Google wants AMD Milan Epyc Chips for its Datacenter Deals with the US Department of Energy (El Capitan), Singapore and Germany, all for public datacenters worth millions of dollars. That's just the tip of the iceberg, as private players are taking note of EPYC. Last,  AMD will power Samsung's S22 flagship phone. Its GPU is expected to break records, as engineering samples already have it beating MALI and Apple's options, by     Samsung wants AMD's chips for its flagship GALAXY S22 But enough on the PRODUCTS. What about the fundamentals? Revenue growth is expected at 50% by the end of 2021. How many companies are growing by 50%? And that guidance was provided with the Q1 results in April, which were exceeding expectations. AMD raised the guidance from 37% to 50%... and will certainly BEAT IT. AMD is NOW a profitable company... and it literally CANNOT keep its products on shelves, as its clients are buying ALL THEIR CHIPS. AMD's valuation is $110 billion, while NVIDIA (w/slightly more revenue & profit) is $500 billion. How is NVIDIA 5 times the value of AMD???... Just because of a stock split? It is currently trading at 38 times earnings, which if they grow by 50% in 6 months, will certainly drop. So yeah, the stock is currently above $90 and aiming to reach its all-time high of $99 which was reached a few months ago, in January. Analyst consensus of the stock is currently $106.54 ( If you ask me, AMD should be  Lastly, the Xilinx acquisition, which will aim to create synergies among functions (e.g. HR, Procurement, Engineering, etc.). It will also increase AMD's share of the silicon purchasing world, as TSMC will have AMD as its #2 client, only second to Apple. Xilinx cancelled its dividends as its shareholders approved the merger with AMD. AMD may choose to bring dividends back after the merger... yet in the meantime, they announced a $4 Billion share buyback program. They know their stock is trading  On the positions (full disclosure): YES, I hold AMD stock. I bought $25K back in 2013, when the stock was at $2.46 (on January 18th, 2013), a bit over 10150 stocks. I saw the stock go up to $20 and sold half of it in 2018. Later, I bought back a bit (crazy ape mentality). Today, I stand with 7500 stocks. Certainly worth a couple of Lambo's, yet I drive a Nissan. If you ask me, my next car should be a TESLA... with AMD chips (yet I'm not selling AMD). WE ALREADY PASSED THE MOON, we will pass  Join me, together we will conquer the Universe!!!

He's been working his ass off for weeks of 100h+ to make you the DD of the year. If you want the Lambo read the DD if you want the bus, skip the DD Why is TTCF about to devour the food industry? Even if I, and probably tons of you, are beef eaters rather than grass enjoyers, it's estimated that a 100m degenerated in the US right now that are interested in plant-based foods, but there hasn't been enough innovation within their sector to really fulfill their needs. The food industry is dominated by the same companies since the 1950s. However, we've seen starting to disrupt this sector. We want to invest in this innovation, in a way that gives a high probability of great returns. Here comes the most undervalued company in this sector, TTCF and likely in the whole market. By disrupting the market, TTCF is not competing with anyone right now, they are creating their own market. They are not competing in the plant-based meat category, they are creating a whole array of plant-based foods, but most importantly, products that customers actually like. This is pioneering at its best. I can already hear you saying: oK bUt wHaT aBoUt BYND? Beyond Meat only produces plant-based meat. TTCF has a whole range of plant-based MEALS, like a ratatouille that tastes better than R√©mi's and ready in minutes, cauliflower mac & cheese, etc. They have products for everyone. Your average fitness girl that eats her A√ßai Bowl like a hipster, your risotto for your date night, a pizza for a Football Match. You get the idea. These guys source all their vegetables from their fields in fucking Italy to get you the best possible Pomodoro on the whole damn planet. I like the product but who gives a shit, here are reviews from a vast array of different people so you can make your mind on what most folks think about their products         If you don't trust the reviews and think it's all the same person, then look at this.     The sell-through is ridiculous, I have more pictures of empty shelves than photos with my parents. The lucky few who discovered TTCF LOVE the product, there's no doubt about that, but most folks haven't heard of TTCF yet. TTCF hasn't even spent a dime on marketing yet. They've only started their first advertising campaign this quarter! We know from Walmart data, that people who have tried the product are coming back without any ads. I can guarantee you that this is pretty rare in the food industry. We are witnessing a beast in the making. They are even expanding in the Mexican food industry. Look at the reviews by yourself, they are going to eat Chipotle alive ($42 bn food giant) without a sweat. Now that they will start marketing, this is going to supercharge sales. Their recent acquisition will allow them to ramp up production and meet this demand.  The growth they have is just insane and historical in this industry. They achieved these results without spending a dime in marketing.  They've been conservative on their targets and have always beaten their revenue expectation.  They are vertically integrated. For the toddlers in the back that have no idea what I'm talking about, it means they own the whole damn supply chain. From the vegetables all the way to the final product. They are constantly increasing capacity to be able to meet demand. This enables TTCF to munch on inflation, as they don't have suppliers. Essentially, this will guarantee rock-solid margins once they slow down their growth and focus on profitability. This also means they'll be able to diversify out of frozen food. TTCF is super cash-rich with not debt! Other acquisitions are likely to come, increasing their domination in the industry. Keep in mind that TTCF is only selling in the US for now. They are going to be growing even faster, once they start expanding in Europe and the rest of the world.  Valuation   TTCF has more growth and trades at a much lower multiple than its peers. And I've taken the analyst's estimates for 2022 and 2023, but these are rookie numbers and they are very likely to beat them. Indeed, this dumb-ass analyst forgot to do his job and price the catalysts, as explained below. TTCF is worth about 6 times less than BYND, for example,  but has more growth and trades at a lower multiple. You're essentially getting a BYND but for one-sixth of the price. But most importantly, their products taste 1000x better. The day TTCF really ramps up marketing and starts doing partnerships with famous people, they'll be trading at a much higher EV/Sales ratio. Just like OTLY with Oprah. Unlike many other companies on this list, TTCF is not burning cash like there's no tomorrow, and is almost profitable, putting them in a strong position to continue to acquire new companies.  Unpriced News and Catalysts This is where it gets interesting, and for once you have a real hedge. A lot of positive information has not been priced yet, as only 2 analysts are covering the stock. Even on my company's freaking expensive Bloomberg Terminal, there's almost no analysis of the stock. Just Google any of the following catalysts, you'll find nothing. Fortunately for you, I've been following this stock for longer than your wife's had a boyfriend, and this is what I found.    THE HISTORY OF TARGET! It gets even better. They only launched Target products on March 15 Analysts expect TTCF to do 54m this quarter, which is only 1m more than they did in Q1. There is absolutely no way, literally impossible that TTCF doesn't beat these numbers by at least 10m, bare minimum. With a nationwide Target presence, these numbers are a piece of cake to beat. On earnings day this could easily pop 15%.  On Friday, I was doing a list of all company's selling TTCF products, I noticed a glitch on Kroger's. I entered a specific query in their engine. I  saw a page containing TTCF products, but no announcement was made yet! This is huge. No one has seen that. Considering this is such a big deal. When these two sleepy analysts and the hedgies find this out (any time now), you can expect a very large green dildo. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, suits will soon wake up. You either eat them now or they'll rob you tomorrow. If they have the same success as in Target, my god they're gonna destroy their estimates. The stock could easily rise 10% on the day investors learn this.   Last Friday at the close, TTCF got added into the Russel 3000 and Russel 2000. This will increase awareness of the stock in Wallstreet and most likely prop up prices thanks to passive index tracking.   Price Targets and Outlook I've been in the market for years and have never seen a stock like this. Considering all the unpriced information, this stock can conservatively hit  A  You can play it like a degenerate gambler and buy calls, but I'd recommend buying shares.

Its server business was under serious threat with the advent of cloud computing; its personal computing and productivity business were... stagnant, to say the least. But with the help of its scale, MSFT reoriented its entire towards new business models like cloud and SaaS. It opened up its Azure platform like AWS, and transformed Office into a huge ARR generating machine. The result? Its share price appreciation and valuation speak for themselves. On the other hand, IBM decided to double down on its on-prem centric business, paddling products like hybrid and private cloud. They decided to focus on their relationship with large accounts and didn't advertise their platform to the burdgeoning startup community. The result? Stagnation.   MSFT Total Return vs GOOGL & IBM; Jun 2010 - Jun 2021   MSFT EV/Fwd EBITDA vs GOOGL & IBM; Jun 2010 - Jun 2021  Fast forward to today, everyone thinks VIAC is dead. Its linear business is under the threat of streaming platforms like NFLX, and its ad business under structural decline thanks to programmatic advertising platforms like GOOGL's Adwords, which are miles better in terms of targetability and traceability. The response from VIAC management has been a swift shift into streaming. They bought Pluto, which enables Adwords-like targetted advertising; consolidated their vast media assets into P+; and reconstituted the entire company's leadership to focus more on streaming. Will VIAC become more of a MSFT or an IBM in the age streaming? I think chances are good for the former."

My job was to go through earning reports and keep up with geopolitical bullshit all over the globe. Now, I trade with my own funds. I work for myself.¬† Now, let‚Äôs go back to J Pow. He said a couple of days ago that they expect inflation to go up. My autistic brain tells me that there will be some market movement and some funds will change hands. He also said that the rates would eventually go up. What will happen in the next 6 months to a year? With a higher Fed interest rate, Macroeconomically, high growth stocks will go down as well Dow stocks because it will become more expensive to borrow money. However, that change is scheduled two years down the road, so why the transition will happen faster? Because big capital is always ahead of the market, that‚Äôs why those pendejos stay rich. Big capital will dump all their high growth shit and move to safer options. As for inflation rate, higher rates trigger a transfer from growth stocks to commodities because those are considered refuge assets. Gold, Silver and all the other shit that your grandma loves to buy is part of that. Those things will go up, but me I don‚Äôt fuck with that boomer shit because I‚Äôd rather invest in a commodity that has real use and growth potential.     My two main targets are Uranium and copper.

Also, posting this as discussion because I don't think this is suitable as DD. It isn't as extensive as most DD is, and I'm here to see what other people think.] [Also, no part of this post should be construed as financial/investing advice. You should always do your due diligence before putting your money anywhere, and this is no exception.] Tl;dr: Leveraged ETFs such as SPXL, UPRO, TQQQ tend to be very favorable over the long run, despite popular belief. They tend to over-perform their leverage when the return is positive, and under-perform their leverage when the return is negative, causing there to be a sort of lopsided upside. In this post, I attempt to find a way to model the return of SPXL, a 3x leveraged bull S&P 500 ETF, based on the return of SPY, over long periods of time (mainly 1 year). It seems that the general consensus among investors is that leveraged ETFs are a bad long-term investment mainly because these ETFs only multiply the the return of the underlying  The second main argument against leveraged ETFs is that, as a consequence of the magnified movement of the underlying up and down, the math works against leveraged ETFs, causing them to lose value over time - a phenomenon known as  Either way, the main purpose of this post is not to counter the second argument, but to address the concern behind the uncertainty of the long-term returns of leveraged ETFs. I did so by trying to develop a mathematical model that predicts the return of the 3x leveraged ETF (SPXL) based on the return of underlying (SPY) over a one-year timeframe. First, I collected the historical prices of SPY daily since 1993. Then, I calculated the daily return of SPY (in %) every day since 1993 using the formula: (close - open)/open * 100 to get a distribution of all daily returns historically for SPY. I could now model SPY's movement over longer periods of time by stringing together these returns - specifically, I was able to simulate SPY's yearly return and a 3x leveraged S&P bull by randomly selecting 250 daily returns (since there are 250 trading days in a year) from my distribution of all daily returns. I did this 10,000 times to simulate 10,000 years. I then plotted the the 3x daily-leveraged ETF VS SPY, and the results were interesting:   As you can see, there seems to be a very clear polynomial/exponential pattern shown with some variability. I fit a cubic model to this data and it seems to be a nice fit:   The axes are kind of mislabeled: it was supposed to say SPXL on the y-axis and SPY on the x-axis, not vice-versa. My primary observation is that the data seems to be curved in a way that makes the 3x leveraged ETF very favorable - it tends to overperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes up (for instance, when SPY goes up 25% in a year, it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go up by more than 75%, in this case almost 100%) - and it tends to underperform the 3x leverage when SPY goes down (for instance, when SPY goes down 10%, it is estimated that the leveraged ETF will go down by less than 30%. This is supported by historical data - SPY has gone up an impressive 42% in the last year while SPXL has returned 173%, more than 3*42 = 126%. Obviously this model would be meaningless if I didn't test it with actual, historical data. SPXL was established back in 2009, so I used the plugged all the yearly returns of SPY since 2009 into my model to predict the yearly returns of SPXL since 2009, and I compared those findings to the actual yearly returns of SPXL since 2009. On average, I was off by about 9%, which isn't really that impressive but is still reasonable when you take into account that the average absolute return of SPXL is about 56%. To me, overestimating or underestimating 56% by 9% isn't a big deal. From what I saw, it is very good in predicting the return if the volatility is less, since that leaves less room for compounded variability. The model was eerily accurate in predicting the return of 173% in the last year - it was off by about 2%. It was very inaccurate in predicting the return of SPXL in 2020, mainly because that was a period of high volatility and low net movement. I haven't really rigorously tested the model, but I plan on doing so when I get the time. An analysis with QQQ and TQQQ yields similar results, which leads me to believe that leveraged ETFs are a good way to get better returns. Although it isn't advisable to pour your life savings into such instruments, investing a part of your portfolio in leveraged ETFs might be the move.

BeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD‚Äôs and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article   OpenFit (backed by Lebron & Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article  OpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness over 700 physical locations , giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link   A simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer.But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition. I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one. Interestingly, Myx has sold over 27,000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month. The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at $1,299 is $600 cheaper than peloton‚Äôs basic bike.  Shakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life. They‚Äôve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020, ‚Äúthe sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport¬Æ, a third-party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270+ substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label‚Äù You can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info.

Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they‚Äôll have what they referred to as a ‚Äúwar chest‚Äù of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&A, marketing, and expansion.  The team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10+ countries in the near future.  If you check company's website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers, almost 3.4 million paid subs, thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people. Celebrities backing this one Lebron, Shaq, and Arnold together have 70 !!!! million followers only on Twitter, on Instagram they have over 100 million!!!!. Insiders have also thousands of followers, so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people.  Important also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order to connect with each other, in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people, subs and coaches to connect each other. Lets talk about  Anytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in. What about???  Why would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are  Say the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes. Lets see if there is any  None. Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews  Finally most important      8.8% only public shares!  Monday $BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available (around 22-25) for shareholders that makes it a very low float stock. Already buying pressure from retail is obvious. Already many tutes have positions with big names among them   Add all of the above to the equation and lets see... The stock already hit 18+ back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20% short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50% of its value. Now shares remaining are very low because  Dont forget Monday $BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above. This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering.     I dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search. All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer.  Some people say $BODY to 0, 5, 20, 30, 50, 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float     Big thanks for taking some parts from the DD of Traditional-Studio-5 and some other BB followers.

Similar to the Trade Desk TTD. They have a very high short interest 43% with a low float of 8.3 mm shares. Recent IPO end of last year. It got crushed anticipating lockup expiry. The IPO lockup expiry happened two weeks ago and was absorbed nicely. Volume has been increasing nicely as the stock has risen off bottom range and is now breaking out above key support levels. The recent Googl news that lifted other ad tech cos like TTD also helped lift the stock recently. Options were listed TODAY which should garner more interest in the name and could potentially provide more fuel for a gamma squeeze. I suspect other strikes will be added in coming days as it continues to go up. This is a great opportunity to buy into a company in a growing field with great potential. The dynamics of low float, high short interest, high borrow cost and limited stock borrow availability make this a good candidate for further moves higher. Plus options!!!!!   I bought TTD at the ipo and sold when it doubled...way too soon.PUBM In my opinion has the same growth trajectory!!! Not financial advice. I am long and simply love this setup for future gains.

At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time. From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.  There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day. Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play. Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider. Positions: 11/05 86c"

The QNX out of box comes with useful software features for car companies to use like camera feed, lidar feed, etc. The first Xpeng car with Auto-pilot is coming in first half 2023(launches in later 2022). Blackberry is already in 24/25 top EV cars. Analyst that work for Candian banks have tried to knock down the stock price for 8 years claiming it's going bankrupt or whatever. I believe they don't understand what the future is and how Blackberry plays a critical role in enabling it. Connected future and cities require high security and safety and that's what blackberry provides. "

473,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"***Disclaimers & Disclosures: This article is meant for discussion and entertainment purposes only. The following is not investment advice, nor a recommendation to buy or sell any security/investment. Investments always carry risk, so DYOR. Stocks included in this article: WBA, AAPL, MSFT, GS, CVS, RAD, WMT, TGT, UNH, CI, DG, JNJ, PG, AMZN, BRK/A, BRK/B. ***  Walgreens ($WBA) is a safe and cheap stock, selling at a discount, with an improving underlying business, and ripe for a buyout. In addition to a healthy 4% dividend, Walgreens is also a major potential takeover target in the healthcare/pharmaceutical space. Selling at attractive valuations, and as both a Dow component and a best-of-breed player in the pharmacy business, we think Walgreens represents a huge investment opportunity. Furthermore, with cheap valuations, a low Beta, and lower correlation to the broader market, we believe WBA is a top defensive play & income producer, and could be added as a core position to anyone‚Äôs portfolio. Including WBA in your portfolio is highly likely to reduce overall portfolio volatility and risk, and improve your performance.  Below are the 6 main reasons we‚Äôre bullish on WBA.   Walgreens stock ($WBA) is a Dow component. As one of only 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the oldest and most historically-followed U.S. market index dating back to the late 1800s), WBA is now considered one of the select large-cap companies which (together) accurately represent the overall market. Though WBA has a small weighting in the Dow (only ~1% when compared to 3% for Apple (AAPL), 5% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 7% for Goldman Sachs (GS), for example), it still stands to benefit greatly from being one of the most visible and widely-followed stocks as part of the Dow index. Moreover, with $Billions (or Trillions) of Dollars in passive investing, a lot of money flows to index funds. As index funds are bought, money is then invested into WBA, which pushes the price up. WBA has A LOT of room to go. Its stock price can increase and earn a higher weighting, which could then trigger a ‚Äúvirtuous cycle‚Äù, where the stock price increases --> WBA weighting increases --> more passive (and active) money flows into WBA --> the stock price increases --> the positive cycle repeats. In short, as a (relatively new) part of the Dow, WBA stock stands to gain. As it benefits from passive/index investing, its market cap can be $Billions larger. The honor of being one of the few companies in the Dow will keep WBA stock visible to investors and will keep the stock supported in a big way.   Walgreens is clearly one o f the largest players and best-of-breed companies in the Pharmacy/Healthcare space. Not only is WBA‚Äôs inclusion in the Dow a huge statement that WBA is best-of-breed, but also the lack of competition and alternative choices in pharmacy stocks is a huge advantage to WBA. With only CVS ($CVS) and Rite-aid ($RAD) as similar peers in the entire market (and with worse financials!), WBA is a clear #1 investment choice.   A 4% dividend makes WBA an income investment opportunity, in addition to the growth and stock price increases we expect to see in the near future. Not only is WBA a relatively safe stock with a low Beta (lower volatility than the broader market), but also the excellent 4% dividend payment is already half of the stock market‚Äôs yearly average return (8%) going back 100+ years. Its further possible that WBA‚Äôs dividend can continue to grow sustainably; in fact, WBA is a blue-chip dividend powerhouse and officially a member of the ""Dividend Aristocrats"", companies which have increased their dividend for 25+ consecutive years. Walgreens has increased its dividend for 45 years and running.   WBA has very attractive valuations, and the stock is selling at a major discount. Investors have a chance right now to buy the stock and a great company at a bargain, right before the stock price could rise by 50%+. Why is the stock so cheap? The company has shown poor stock performance over the past few years mostly due to poor earnings performance, low profitability, and high debt. Fortunately, things are improving and the stock hasn‚Äôt yet reflected the good news. It will soon be priced in, and the stock price will rise. How do we know it‚Äôs cheap? Why is the stock a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù? WBA stock sells at attractive low multiples (1) on an absolute basis (10x forward P/E, 2x P/B, 9x P/FCF), (2) on an historical basis (lowest P/S and near 15-year low P/B and P/FCF), and (3) on a peer comparables basis (WBA is selling at significantly cheaper valuation multiples than Walmart (WMT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG), United Health (UNH), Cigna (CI), etc.). In other words, the stock is cheap on nearly all fronts, and potentially offering a major value investment. If WBA had multiples more comparable to its peer group, the stock would be trading at a significantly higher price. As market participants come to realize this market mispricing/inefficiency, the stock price is likely to adjust higher.   Walgreens‚Äô business and future prospects seem to be improving. With a new CEO at the helm (the first African American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company), along with critical strategic decisions/initiatives likely upcoming, WBA is very well-positioned to grow and gain market share. With most locations (physical stores) in very good condition still looking new, located on prime real estate, and acting as top places to get vaccinated against Covid-19, there is plenty more time in WBA‚Äôs bullish cycle. We will look at the upcoming year‚Äôs revenue, income, and cash flows to judge WBA‚Äôs progress and performance.   The cherry on top for Walgreens ($WBA) stock is a takeover. Walgreens is an attractive takeover target. Especially in the retail/pharmaceutical/healthcare space, Walgreens presents a market-moving opportunity for a large public company or private equity group. In fact, this was attempted not too long ago when in late-2019 KKR ($KKR) showed interest in taking WBA private in the largest private-equity buyout of all-time (see:  There is clearly significant interest in WBA, and it‚Äôs been quiet for a little while. The sleeping lion (or bull?) could wake up at any moment. A takeover has been attempted at much higher prices by private equity buyers. The existence of such investor interest and possible takeover offers provides (1) a strong catalyst for a soaring stock price, and (2) a floor to the stock, which will support the stock at or above current prices. If the stock price drops too far, buyers are highly likely to step in. Additionally, though maybe unlikely, both Amazon ($AMZN) and Warren Buffett / Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK/A)($BRK/B) could be potential buyers. Amazon has shown much interest in expanding into Pharma/Drugs/Prescriptions as well as expanding its retail operation. WBA seems to be a great potential fit; and at only $50-100B, WBA is not such a big purchase for the $2 Trillion market cap Amazon. Warren Buffett and/or Berkshire Hathaway could also be a potential investor. WBA fits many of the criteria which Buffett and other value investors look for. Additionally, Buffett and a joint venture between Amazon, Berkshire, and JP Morgan (called ‚ÄúHaven‚Äù) showed strong interest in disrupting the healthcare sector until recently disbanding (see:  It seems painfully clear that Amazon ($AMZN), Berkshire ($BRK/A)($BRK/B), and other major players are highly-interested in gaining a foothold in the space which Walgreens ($WBA) already dominates. If takeover interest materializes, or if Buffett decides to invest more heavily in WBA, you can bet there will be a lot of attention on the stock, and the stock price is likely to be much higher."
474,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn‚Äôt believe. I turned around and said ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry, what did you just say?‚Äù He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that  So‚Ä¶when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I‚Äôm not joking‚Ä¶ After already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) I immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation.  The dollar index after J. POW‚Äôs Jackson Hole Speech. üòÇ  Now this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I‚Äôm wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I paid for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.  Let me start with my TA first‚Ä¶which is alarming.   Here is one from Thursday, September 2.   Let me explain why‚Ä¶   For fuck sakes people,     So far, 88% of S and P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet. The strong results put the S and P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. üò≥ So‚Ä¶. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings‚Ä¶.which I guarantee that will happen‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to be an earnings miss galore.  Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth. When gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.  This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold. Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this   I like this one better compared to the DOW 30.  The lumber/gold ratio  Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But‚Ä¶gold was up big this week as well‚Ä¶and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.   So‚Ä¶for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.     No big deal right?  No big deal right?   No big deal right?  Now‚Ä¶  Bought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp  One $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash) It basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks‚Ä¶ I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. 2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It‚Äôs holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest.  1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker) One $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC Exp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I‚Äôm wrong)   Simply put‚Ä¶ Good luck out there guys.   I‚Äôm not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I‚Äôm saying that maybe it‚Äôs time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don‚Äôt forget  TLDR: Just read the bold shit‚Ä¶ Edit: Just saw this on Twitter like 5 minutes ago,  Lol‚Ä¶"
475,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"A recurring theme over the past year has been one ‚Äòexpert‚Äô after another bashing index funds calling them a massive bubble that is waiting to pop. ¬†     But at the same time, we have investors like Warren Buffet who still swear by a low-cost index fund and recommends it over his own Berkshire Hathaway stock! So, in this week‚Äôs issue, we analyze both sides of the argument and see if we [1] should be worried about the index fund bubble!  The argument against the index fund is a logical one. The basic premise is that index funds affect the price discovery of stocks in the market. If a stock is bid up just based on the presence in an index and not by analyzing the underlying asset, then it can lead to a bubble-like scenario where you are buying more and more just because the asset prices are going up.    If you look at the above chart, you could see that in the first 4 months of 2021, a fund inflow of more than $20 Billion occurred just to the Vanguard 500 index fund. There are arguments stating that in the US, index funds make up  If you think about this, more than half of the money that is flowing into the market is now just buying stocks that are on an index without doing any underlying stock analysis. The problem becomes that companies get more and more investment just because they are big and not because of their future growth prospects. So the question becomes  The problem with the fund inflow statistics is that stock price is not decided solely based on fund inflow but majorly by trading.    If you look at this  Adding to this, even if the index funds become large enough to create significant price distortions, it‚Äôs something that the active fund managers can benefit from as it would give them more opportunities to short overvalued companies and create outsized returns. The fact that it‚Äôs not happening right now shows that we are not anywhere near a situation where the index fund is big enough to fundamentally alter the market[4]. Now that we know that index funds are not causing any price distortions, one has to wonder  I believe that this issue is being brought up by institutions and active fund managers as there is a drastic shift from active to passive management over the last few years.    The above chart from Morningstar showcases that active funds on average lost more than $150B every year over the 2014-18 period and this trend is only becoming worse for the active funds. This trend is also replicated worldwide with more than $300B is pulled out of active funds and $500B is pushed into index funds every year (as of 2016). Finally, as of 2019, for the first time, more money is being pushed into passive than active funds! All of this must be ringing alarm bells across active funds as their income is directly dependent on the total asset under management.  While researching this topic, I came across some genuine concerns about index funds. The most important of them being that you might not be as diversified as you expect investing in an index fund. As of Aug 2021, the top 5 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN & FB) account for more than 23% of the S&P500! While this worked out great for the overall index over that last decade given the tech rally, any long-term downturn for tech stocks will significantly affect your portfolio. There are two alternatives that I found to the regular market cap based index fund allocation       I believe that the index fund bubble narrative is over-blown and is being predominantly driven active fund managers who are trying to stop losing their business to the passive funds every year. All the data from our research shows that we are nowhere near a situation where index funds can alter the price discovery in any significant way! While the index fund bubble might be getting undeserved attention, it's always a good thing to check if you are comfortable with the current skewness of your portfolio towards tech stocks. After all, the tech rally over the last decade has undoubtedly benefitted all our portfolios, but we should also be ready for when the party inevitably comes to a close! Until next week :)  [1] This is the first time in an analysis where I cannot claim to be unbiased as a substantial portion of my portfolio (>90%) is tied up in an index fund. So take all the arguments with a grain of salt! [2]  [3] This study also showcases that ETF trading (creation/redemption mechanism of exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) has minimal impact on the underlying securities as only 6% of the trading is involved in primary market trading with the rest being in the secondary market. [4] This is also known as the Grossman-Stigliztz paradox:- There would be a point where indexing would become big enough to affect price discovery, then active managers would be able to profit off that, and more and more people would move to the active funds. Finally, in an efficient market, an equilibrium point would be reached where neither party (index funds or active fund managers) would be able to beat each other."

And its stock is inexpensive. By Eric J. Savitz This should be a magical moment for Plantronics, the producer of conference-room products and office headsets, better known as Poly. With a gradual return to the office, there is expected to be a surge in ""hybrid meetings"" -- mixing in-person and virtual participants. Poly CEO Dave Shull estimates that there are about 50 million conference rooms globally, and that 10% or less are equipped for videoconferencing. That is a huge potential opportunity for Poly (ticker: POLY) and its competitors. Shares of Poly, meanwhile, have been driven down to bargain-basement levels by the fallout from an ill-fated merger three years ago. At a recent $32, the stock now trades for about 0.7 times anticipated revenue for the March 2023 fiscal year, and just under eight times projected profits for the same period. In comparison, Logitech International (LOGI), which has an overlapping set of products, trades for about 3.2 times revenue and 22 times projected profits for the same period. At such deeply discounted levels, investors willing to be patient could reap rich rewards as a turnaround gets underway at Poly."

This honestly leads us to wonder when the next ATH will be, when will $AAPL hit 155, 160? $AAPL reached ATH recently near $151~ range and seems to be consolidating for now. While looking at open interests on AAPL options today, I noticed a whopping volume of 210k for 9/17 150c volume. Are the hedgies or MM's blasting $AAPL up to new ATH soon?  Yes even though $AAPL's trading average is 70~80M shares per day, an influx of 150 ITM calls will create 21M more shares that need to be covered.

The bad, company has been around for 20 some years and poor revenue each year making most call it an overvalued shit stock, but I figure if the DOD is paying Microsoft $20bn for a military version of the Hololens (IVAS) then their tech must be good, which should translate over to their automotive lidar. If you then compare their market cap vs other speculative lidar companies market caps then they start to seem undervalued, having the NED technology is just an added bonus. Anyhow this post was less of a DD as others have gone to much greater extents explaining the value of this company and their tech, my main reason posting is to share my bet in the open then come mid Sept we can all see it play out for better or for worse. Oh almost forgot, MVIS will be at a mobility conference in Germany Sept 7-12 where they'll publicly demo their lidar units for the first time, claiming best in class, addressing SWAP-C and OEM / Tier 1 needs. Oh one more, MVIS couldn't acknowledge MSFT as being their customer until the last EC when it was announced due to NDA. Why the sudden change? Well if the NED vertical was in the process of being sold off to MSFT then trying to hide it doesn't really matter anymore.

483,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,," This is the options chain for the calls expiring this week.  3200 was clearly a significant number, and AMZN closed at 3199.95.  That's fucking hilarious.  Someone clearly wanted it below that number.   The 5 minute chart is super bullish into close today   The daily chart makes it pretty obvious that it's bottomed out.   3180 has been a crucial level many times in the past.  This level is also the point of control, which is where most of the volume has occurred in recent history.  These high volume areas are institutional buying.  We probably should have corrected more this week, at least to the 50 day moving average for SPY.  That would've been healthy, and it seemed like it tried to every day.  If you made money this week, well done, because I definitely got trapped.  Microsoft just kept popping, along with the rest of big tech except for AMZN.  The fact that every dip was bought up like nothing(especially Monday, what the fuck was that shit) means were probably going higher.  But big tech, the linchpin of the financial world right now, is stretched pretty thin with the exception of AMZN.  I think MSFT cools off next week, and AMZN pumps to keep us painfully churning here. Position: 8/27 3215c  Edit:  forgot to add the unusual call buying today for next week at the 3200 strike.   I'll gladly take a 30 day ban if I'm wrong, but I want a flair if I'm right.   Also, I'm not saying its going to run back to all time highs.  I'm saying it'll bounce from the selling pressure being exhausted for the time being.  Looking for a bounce to 3350 in the short term.  After that, no clue.  It'll probably continue its downtrend."
484,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"Dear ARVL Stock Fans, Big Catalysts Are Coming for Arrival in 2021 InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Today, investors in UK-based electric vehicle (EV) startup Arrival (NASDAQ:ARVL) are seeing some pretty steep declines. In fact, shares of ARVL stock are currently down approximately 7% at the time of writing. Today‚Äôs price action seems to indicate investors are presently looking elsewhere for growth. Source: BigPixel Photo / Shutterstock.com However, there are a few catalysts long-term investors in this early stage EV company will like. Various catalysts saw shares of this de-SPAC (special purpose acquisition company) surge from its SPAC initial public offering (IPO) level of $10 to as high as $37 earlier this year on intense momentum among SPAC stocks. However, like many of Arrival‚Äôs de-SPAC peers, recent price action has not been favorable of late. In fact, Arrival has lost more than two-thirds of its market value from its peak. Investors placing their bets on the EV sector appear to be focusing in on the bigger, more established players today. Accordingly, Arrival remains a high-risk, high-reward bet in the world of EV stocks. That said, let‚Äôs dive into two key catalysts that could position ARVL stock for a nice run. Two Catalysts Are the Key for Investors in ARVL Stock Investors in ARVL stock are making a bet that this early stage EV company can hit its production targets. Today, executives told investors that the company is on track to begin production of its EV bus and van in 2022. This is big news, as investors price in the timing of cash flows into their models. Any early stage EV company carries some level of execution risk. Investors betting on ARVL stock are essentially betting on the management team to do what they say they‚Äôre going to do. Indeed, this not only means on the production end of the equation but on the demand side as well. Investors are expecting updates on the company‚Äôs fulfillment plans for its key van order with UPS (NYSE:UPS). This order is expected to bring in more than $1 billion in revenue for Arrival. Secondly, investors looking at ARVL stock will have to consider a key announcement the company made last week. Last Thursday, the company announced plans to partner with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on developing a cloud-based data platform for EV fleets. Given Microsoft‚Äôs backing for this project, many investors have begun to get excited about the technology angle with ARVL stock. However, again, this comes back to execution. Investors seem to be waiting for tangible results on these projects before jumping aboard. Accordingly, it appears ARVL stock is one that‚Äôs likely to be volatile for some time, as investors price in these catalysts alongside operational risk.

485,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"As I am sure you are aware, if like me you are an investor in $AAPL that the stock has done quite a bit of consolidating for the past month after making new highs back in mid July but I believe I have spotted signs of a very lucrative opportunity. So let me begin with some TA or as I like to call it SA (Stonk Astrology)  $AAPL 1 day 2 year chart   $AAPL 1 hour 30 day chart  What am I looking at? You might be asking and that's a decent question. So let me explain first starting with the 1 day/ 2 year chart. This chart I'm using to show that Apple tends to have its run ups preceding earnings. On that note if you have ever been wondering why you always get IV crushed at earnings its because Apple is so reliably profitable and has grown so consistently throughout its life span that Wall Street tends to price in that Apple will meet or exceed expectations well before they actually announce. This tends to be the pattern for most of the mega cap stocks that are highly globalized and have monopolistic tendencies. (think: MSFT AMZN GOOGL probably). This second graph is the more important one as it actually shows actionable data. If you direct your goldfish-like attention to the 1 hour 30 day chart you can take a look at some things that I have laid out. 1.)  The orange lines: they form a triangle if you didn't notice that than you definitely shouldn't be trading stocks, but if you have gotten far enough to identify a triangle than you can probably handle the idea of a breakout. As these triangles form they general lead to a breakout from the triangle formation and on to higher, highs or lower, lows. that's it, not that hard to understand 2.) Purple Lines: Just a trace of the prices to better visualize the patterns forming 3.) Blue Lines: Simple moving avg I set my 3 moving avgs. to 20, 50, and 200, When the cross or spread out  they can help identify downturns or breakouts respesctively. 4.) Red Lines: this is a fib retracement which uses the fib. sequence to help identify support and resistance levels between the highs and lows of and stock and beyond. The fib. retractions are the most difficult to explain because simply put I literally have no idea why prices using fib. levels as support and resistance. That being said, my research indicated to me that no one else could really explain it either, whether or not prices actually act this way or since everyone uses fib sequences that we cause price to act that way. Either way I have found these work really well when Identifying support and resistance. Studies: I'm just going to clump these into to the same category but these are the charts that you seen on the bottom first one is volume, second one is the ATR which is relative volatility, and MACD which helps indicate refeversals and RSI which helps identify overbought and oversold conditions The trade: so what this chart is telling me is that $AAPL has been consolidating for some months and could break out to new highs. What I am going to do is buy the oct 15 $155 call or the sept 17 $155 call if you are feeling confident like me. Something important I forgot to mention above is that $AAPL's implied volatility is not only historically low but also below the historical one year avg. What this means is that not only will your call option increase in value due to the run up in price but the run up IV that is likely to happen will compound your gains. Why is this likely to happen simply the law of averages?   $AAPL IV vs. historical IV  Couple of notes: first I am not a financial advisor just a dude with a hobby, second obviously TA is a good look into what has happened historically it doesn't guarantee that it will happen. That being said, if this TA begins to bring down I would look at the $143.50 level as confirmation and as for confirmation on the upside you should look for the previous high of $150. To make this trade successful you might want to consider staggering your buys instead of the traditional balls deep all at once. For an example I have already entered this trade with 10 shares at an avg. of $147 and a sep. 17 $155 call at the same price. I plan to buy more 155 calls for both sept and oct. as the price drifts up to $150 if all goes to plan I am looking at a pt of around $160 TLDR: I thing this is the begining of the apples run up before q3 earnings sep 17 $155 calls Positions: 10 Shares at 147.50 1 Sept. 17 155 call"
486,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,," ¬† What‚Äôs poppin‚Äô bull-gang, Flux here with an options exit strategy ‚Äúguide‚Äù. I wanted to make this writeup because more often than not, I see people making fundamentally sound trades, only to have their gains vanish due to having poor exit strategy. They either get too greedy and hold on for way too long, or they exit way too early and miss out on an insane runup and want to die for a couple of days afterwards. There‚Äôs two parts to each trade - an entry and an exit - and if you‚Äôre caught skimping on either end, you‚Äôre gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. Although this part of trading isn‚Äôt glamourous, it‚Äôs absolutely vital to your overall success as a trader, so it‚Äôs crucial that you learn and study these concepts sooner rather than later. With all that being said, let‚Äôs get into it. ¬†  Types of Exits There‚Äôs three types of exits that I tend to use when I conduct my trades, each useful in their own right. I‚Äôll give a quick summary of them all, before providing an in depth analysis and examples of each. ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬† Obviously there are going to be a handful of strategies and categories which I‚Äôve missed, but the ones I outlined above are likely going to be the ones which are most common to us retail traders. ¬†  Fundamental Exits  ¬† Algorithms, or algos for short, are always behind the inevitable tanking of a stock's price post news event. It‚Äôs quite easy to see why once you understand how these algorithms work. An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they‚Äôre at a huge advantage since they  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  ¬† In both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains.  ¬†  Exiting Around Earnings This is a very simple concept once we understand the mechanisms outlined above. If you‚Äôre in a trade, always look to close it out before earnings (unless you wanna get rug pulled, in which case go ahead, I'm not your daddy). If the news is priced in (which it probably is), you‚Äôll get front run by algos and they‚Äôll steal your profits. Do not gamble on the ‚Äúpriced-in‚Äú news being wrong. You‚Äôll lose that bet 9/10 times. Please note that even if earnings is a beat, that ‚Äúbeat‚Äù can still be priced in. Please, exit your trades before earnings, or you run the risk of getting blown out due to your own ignorance. ¬† Exiting Around Product Launches This is similar to the concept we outlined above. In this hypothetical example, let‚Äôs say $AAPL announces that they‚Äôre going to reveal a new line of products in August. If that‚Äôs the case, get ready to exit your position before the event. Every August $AAPL showcases their new iPhones for the year, therefore even though they haven‚Äôt explicitly said they‚Äôre going to reveal iPhones, the market is gonna price the event as if iPhones are going to be revealed. Once they reveal that their new products are in fact iPhones, the price will tank, because it was priced in, and algos followed the exact behavior outlined earlier. The only instance in which the price wouldn‚Äôt tank would be if they announced that they‚Äôre releasing a teleportation device or something. Believe it or not, the odds of that happening are astronomically low, so you‚Äôre better off just selling before the reveal instead. Unless $AAPL comes out with something totally unexpected, the price will drop. ¬† Exiting Around Fundamental News Events This pertains to market moving news as a whole, like an FOMC speech or some macroeconomic event. If you know that JPow is gonna speak on Wednesday, it‚Äôs probably best to exit your position before that since you‚Äôve honestly got no idea what‚Äôs gonna happen as a byproduct of it. The entire market could take a shit or could fly green, nobody knows. Since we‚Äôre traders, not gamblers, it‚Äôs in our best interest to exit our positions or hedge in order to shield our gains. Fundamental news events are often crapshoots, and are the leading cause of solid gains getting unjustly erased in an instant. ¬†  Technical Exits Technical exits pertain to any form of exit strategy regarding a chart or an indicator - often a combination of the two. In order to have the ability to do a technical exit, you must have a basic understanding of technical charts, patterns, and indicators. The entire field of technical analysis is easy to understand, but hard to master, so even if you don‚Äôt have much experience in the area, I‚Äôll do my best to explain it all in a way which is friendly towards newer traders. ¬†  Exiting Around Support and Resistance This is often one of the easiest exits to perform, as it‚Äôs fairly straightforward to identify on a chart.  ¬† An awesome example of this would be the  ¬† You may be wondering if there‚Äôs any way you can capture the EXTRA gains in the event that the support or resistance levels don‚Äôt hold. Although I don‚Äôt recommend doing it too often, a well placed stop-loss can help protect your gains in the event that we reject off of a support or resistance, while simultaneously KEEPING you in the trade if we break through the support or resistance. Obviously, you‚Äôll need some experience trading to know exactly where to place your stop, and it‚Äôs going to vary from ticker to ticker based on IV and the type of security or derivative you‚Äôre trading. A well placed stop-loss can help magnify your returns while also preventing you from giving up any gains you‚Äôve already locked in. Be wary, too tight of a stop could take you out of a trade entirely before a run, but too loose of a stop could cause you to give up too much of your unrealized gains. It‚Äôs a fine line to play, and that only comes with experience. ¬† Another way you could play breakouts is by using a two stepped approach. First, you take your exit once you approach a given level of support or resistance to lock in your gains. You then set an alert within your broker slightly higher than that given level. If your alert gets tripped, you know that there‚Äôs been a breakout, and you‚Äôre clear to re-enter the trade to then capture any extra gains that may occur once it starts to run. If I run this strategy, I make sure to set my stop under the newly broken support or resistance in order to preserve my capital in the event of a false breakout. In the end, this method is much safer, but it requires you to sit at your computer twiddling your thumbs waiting for a breakout, so I personally don‚Äôt prefer it. ¬†  Exiting Around Gaps Before we get into how to trade gaps, we need to understand what gaps are, and why they occur.  ¬† When trading gaps, we need to recognize two important levels, and understand how price will act around them.  ¬† Understanding all of that, gap trades are relatively simple. First, we ride our trade up to our first level of resistance (the beginning of the gap, aka the price that the first trade was conducted at), and then take our exit to lock in our profits. Afterwards, we set an alert slightly above the resistance, so we get notified once we‚Äôre past the resistance and are in the gap. Since we know there‚Äôs no trading volume within the gap, there‚Äôs a good chance we will get sucked through to the other side, meaning we should look to re-enter the trade as quickly as possible and then ride it to the opposite end of the gap (the end of the gap aka the price that the last trade was conducted at before the gap was created). Once we get to the opposite end of the gap, we fully exit the trade, because we know that 99% of the time we will reject off of this next heavy level of resistance. Gaps have a very rigid structure, and trade very similar to a breakout play. Enter a trade, exit at first resistance. Re-enter the trade after we break resistance, exit once we‚Äôre at the second resistance. ¬†  ¬†  Clear Skies and Falling Knives A clear skies situation refers to when a stock is on a tear and has recently carved out new all time highs - think  ¬†  ¬†  ¬†  Technical Caveats  ¬† If $MSFT announces that they‚Äôre coming out with a time machine, don‚Äôt expect the stock's price to bounce off of the nearest overhead resistance, as that level is now void. $MSFT has fundamentally changed as a company, and as a result, the technicals will also need to change to reflect that. The same is true to the downside. If $MCD announces that they‚Äôve been grinding up humans and putting them into their hamburgers, don‚Äôt expect the nearest level of support to hold - it‚Äôs void. The stock will plunge into free fall until $MCD is properly priced given it‚Äôs new fundamentals. Only then can we look to start re-establishing our technicals. ¬†  ¬†  Psychological Exits Psychological exits consist of concepts and rules derived from how humans think and react to certain events. They are more conceptual in nature, and will vary from person to person. They aren‚Äôt necessarily as concrete as the other types of exits due to their ambiguous nature. Everyone will apply these exits differently, and as a result I can‚Äôt give you a consistent set of rules for each one. I can just explain the general concepts and provide different contexts regarding when to apply them. The rest is up to you! ¬†  Screenshot Theory This is a very simple concept that I actually adopted from Wall Street Bets of all places -  ¬† Individual Gain Theory This concept refers to when you‚Äôre trading with money that you cannot afford to lose, and you come in on somewhat of a win. Profit or loss, this money is going to fundamentally alter your life (for better or worse) because you were put in a position where you had to ‚Äútrade‚Äù money which you also needed elsewhere. If you‚Äôre ever in a situation where you‚Äôre forced to trade to make some extra dough, take those profits asap. A loss is often going to make your life a hell of a lot worse than a win will. ¬† Exiting Around Whole Numbers Humans are weird creatures - we like ‚Äúwhole‚Äù or ‚Äúround‚Äù stuff, numbers being no exception. How often do you catch yourself submitting a buy order for 20$, or a sell order for $50. Unless you‚Äôre cognizant of it, you‚Äôre not going to think to yourself ‚Äúimma buy $CLF at 21.83‚Äù. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre gonna round it up to $22, or down to $20, etc. The same goes for literally EVERYONE else. Just keep in mind that depending on the direction you‚Äôre trading, there‚Äôs often going to be buyers / sellers at whole numbers. $10, $20, $25, $30, etc. No number is safe. Look to time your exits before or after these numbers, as they may prove to be mini points of resistance. You‚Äôll often see sellers step in at whole numbers on the way up, and buyers step in at whole numbers on the way down. Use this to your advantage. ¬†  Emotional Exits This concept applies to two key emotions - Euphoria and Hope.  ¬† You need to be conscious of the fact that you‚Äôre euphoric, and that this trade went awesome, and exit the position intelligently. Once you start feeling euphoria, and consequently hope, there‚Äôs no going back. You‚Äôre not trading on fundamentals, and you‚Äôre not trading on technicals either. You‚Äôre simply not trading rationally. In situations like this, it‚Äôs best to take a step back and exit the trade before you make a boneheaded move and end up giving your gains away. Emotions cloud judgement, and as traders, that‚Äôs the last thing we want. Sell out of a position once you start feeling intense emotion. ¬†  Conclusion All in all, options trading is a difficult game with many moving parts - If you're caught skimping on your exits, you‚Äôre gonna be kneecapping your gains on a regular basis. This aspect of trading is less glamorous and often overlooked, but is absolutely vital to your success as a trader. I hope this writeup was informative and useful to you all! "

Well given the current evaluations on American/Canadian tickers currently I think this is a mistake. You have companies like AAPL and MSFT trading at absurd multiples. So maybe be a bear you might ask? Well bears have gotten crushed all year long so I would argue it's to early to be a bear. So what the hell are you supposed to do? You can't buy, you can't sell and you just did three lines of cocaine and want to gamble. The answer: Chinese stocks, the Chinese stock market has recently corrected and seems to have found support at these levels. I think Chinese stocks are where one can find value currently. The TA looks good and if the numbers aren't cooked to oblivian you might even find some good long term value in BABA and other Chinese big cap stocks. So ya the summery is if you wanted to buy Chinese stocks in the last 2 months you will had a hard time finding value up until now. I think over the next day or two these stocks find a bounce to indicate a move higher. Just make sure the company you bought has been recently investigated for Fraud as these companies are probably less likely to try and cook the books in the short term with regulators breathing down their necks.

491,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"Now that I got your attention, I‚Äôm thinking there is going to be a (possibly major) correction mid-way next week.  FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly. Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It‚Äôs unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.  TA says we‚Äôre reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).  Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1% from here at $370~$371 EWT says we‚Äôre reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance. Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.   The stars have aligned for a (bigly) drop. Position: QQQ 361p 08/06"
492,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"We have all read that ""it is not COVID's effect on people"", it is ""how businesses and governments react with restrictions"" .. that effects stocks.  Bored of this, heard it too many times?  Not scared any more? Well the virus and variants didn't get bored. Reviewing the top five economies and their case trends ------------------------- Source : Worldometers.info USA:  new cases curving upward, especially in FL China:  they lie about their numbers Japan:  new cases increasing at a roughly linear rate Germany: new cases growing again, though off of a low base France:  new cases surging and strong in the numbers, curving up UK:  new cases surged though showing signs of starting to drop Keeping your elder family members safe from your infecting them is still a cultural truth. One political party in a given country wants to make another fail.  One party will weaponize the virus and threaten the other to take action.  This is what leads to restrictions.  Before it was the Democrats shutting down businesses to make the economy worse for Republicans.  Now it is the same, but Repub states will shut down and Dem states will want to keep businesses open.  In another country similar games will play out. So all the potential economic shut downs are still there. What is different is that all the technology that was bought to have the kids educate from home, such as tablets and web cams and online meeting subscriptions don't need to be bought a second time so soon.  So the 2nd set of restrictions on the population comes without a sector that gets an economic boost.  The exception is grocery stores and online shopping. The extra unemployment benefits end on Sept 6th in numerous states, but investors know that and would sell effected stocks sooner.  The moratorium on evictions ends this fall, and so tenants will stop the games and scramble to pay their landlords, taking away their spending money.  If they don't they will get an eviction on their credit record. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Now to valuations  shows that the Schiller PE ratio of stocks is 38.3.  The .com bubble was the highest it ever got, higher than this level for 2.5 years, and getting to the mid 40's.  Other then that, at no time in history was this valuation ratio this high. Note also that in 1982 at the peak of interest rates 13 to 14%, the average stock had a PE of 7 to 9. A book by O'Shoughnessy ""What Works on Wall Street"" studied 40 years of stock market data.  Its results shows that a price to sales ratio is 'the king of value factors', since sales can't be manipulated like earnings can.  shows that this valuation is higher now than at any time charted.  The book suggests that a price to sales of 1.5 is considered a good deal.  We are over twice that level on average. The market breadth has eroded under the mega techs.

This can be hard to find in navigation, but a direct link will help, for example  use .N and .O at the end of the symbol for NYSE and NASDAQ. price to sales: MSFT = 13.3 ; FB = 10.4 ; AAPL = 7.5 ; AMZN = 4.3 ; GOOG = 8.76 ; NVDA = 25.2 ; AMD = 9.5 These clearly can fall and still be overvalued. Some have sighted the growth in the money supply, such as M2, as part of what has pushed the market higher.  However, it is important to note that M2 was recategorized in 2020.  So even though you can go to the Mises Institute's site and see articles of big increases in the M2 money supply, much of that is due to the recategorization and strangely the articles omit this but for a footnote. Inflation ---------------------------------------------- A large part of what we pretend to understand about inflation is the CPI and PCE. We think that we know that the last CPI reading was 5.4%.  That is above the target of 2% of course when action by the recipe is needed.  This coupled with Powell not wanting to raise rates and desiring to de-prioritize inflation is ""bad enough"" from a stock perspective.  Jim Cramer described Powell as ""having a heart"" in wanting to prioritize helping people back to work.  Recall that interest rates have to be jacked up in response to inflation eventually.  Acting to late makes it worse.  From business school texts, higher interest rates put downward pressure on the value of future earnings.  Thus the forward looking value of stocks drops. But I challenge all of you to take the CPI by its percentage components and REBUILD it yourself with online research.  I did.  While the published number was +1.6% year over year at the time, I found no component less than 2%, and most were a good deal higher.  It is easy to find information showing education expenses rising at a +5% annual rate for many years.  Medical costs I found web sites saying +4% annually consistantly over many years.  At the time, only oil was lower than 2% price growth.  Today, with oil back up above $70 a barrel, that is not to be taken lightly. Recently the Fed has emphasized the PCE, the Personal Consumption Expendatures index.  Do you find as I do it strange that they publish the 'this month vs last month' number, making it look like small 0.1 to 0.3% rise, and not the more useful year over year number, which would show a larger % increase? The National Debt takes no small part in the desire to have inflation be low and keep interest rates low.  But that combination is impossible over time. I have been at individual stock investing since 1996 and I have sold most of my stock holdings.  I lived through the .com crash which I took on the chin (with small dollars since I was young and I learned from it such that I was 66% in cash for the crash of 2008.  If you have not been in the habit of thinking about economic impacts, valuations, and questioning what real inflation is, it is certainly time to start. The great bull market of the 1980's in the USA was spurred by the acceleration of women entering the work force and the personal computer.  The great bull market of the 1990's was spurred by implementation of the internet, immigration, and foreign economies developing. What is the story now?  5G networking is just a faster version of the same thing, but only over shorter distances.  Artificial intelligence is intended to replace humans.  Electric vehicles only reduce pollution after 100k miles according to an article in the WSJ.  I think to move on to much higher valuations we need a big economic story that just isn't there right now."

We have to look at economic news to identify causes including:     Furthermore, the PPI (producer price index) also continues to rise at a rate of 1% in June indicating that consumers are still going to see higher prices in the coming months and that overall inflation will overshoot the FED‚Äôs 2% threshold by a wide margin.    All of those events point to a possible correction sometime in the near future. Most experts expect that sometime after Q2 earnings, but it could be starting as we speak, especially that corrections don‚Äôt play out in one straight line. They tend to move in a series of several lower lows and lower highs until bottoming out. It‚Äôs important to also point out that a correction is not a market crash. Corrections are a much smaller event, ranging around a -10% drop on the low end for the leading S&P 500 index and much more for individual speculative stocks. They are a healthy event that helps reinvigorate the market with new buyers. A crash on the other hand is a much larger event that‚Äôs usually provoked by a combination of events or a single major event. Crashes usually last much longer than people expect, well past the initial large drop. There are several catalysts for such an event such as the emergence of a virus variant that outsmarts vaccines or a collapse in the reverse repurchase facility. The most prominent of them however, is QE tapering (quantitative easing) and increase in interest rates. Massive QE and low interest rates have been the driving force behind this bull market. They are the justification given for the current astronomical valuation where the S&P500 Shiller P/E ratio is reaching a whopping 38%! That is a historic high only second to the Dotcom bubble in 2000 (44%) and is in general an unsustainable level in the long term. Some argue that the FED will manage to taper QE and increase interest rates gradually in a very controlled manner and avoid any meltdown, but given rising inflation beyond expectations, the FED might very well be forced to act much sooner than it would like. Equities and bonds expert Ray Dalio explains this process in his most recent video on YouTube."

It opened up its Azure platform like AWS, and transformed Office into a huge ARR generating machine. The result? Its share price appreciation and valuation speak for themselves. On the other hand, IBM decided to double down on its on-prem centric business, paddling products like hybrid and private cloud. They decided to focus on their relationship with large accounts and didn't advertise their platform to the burdgeoning startup community. The result? Stagnation.

Its linear business is under the threat of streaming platforms like NFLX, and its ad business under structural decline thanks to programmatic advertising platforms like GOOGL's Adwords, which are miles better in terms of targetability and traceability. The response from VIAC management has been a swift shift into streaming. They bought Pluto, which enables Adwords-like targetted advertising; consolidated their vast media assets into P+; and reconstituted the entire company's leadership to focus more on streaming. Will VIAC become more of a MSFT or an IBM in the age streaming? I think chances are good for the former."

Baba stock experienced little decline in most recent quarter in comparison to performance from same quarter a year before, but i think the next earning this year will reveal growth in EPS. Now, lets start of with the basics and take a look on baba financial and valuation.  valuation:   so looking at valuations: Mkrt value:  573B p/e: ~25x Fp/e: ~21x p/s: ~5.2x p/b: ~3.9x -> very attractive at this rate ! eps(ttm): 8.48 eps(ntm): ~12 next e/r : Aug 19   At BABA current stock price of $211, the market is expecting revenue to grow at 48.8% for the next 1 years. Over this period, BABA is also expected to generate an average Economic Earnings Margin of 13.8% Baba have increased theirlong term debt looking at their financials but due to increase in future revenue i believe it is nothing to be bothered by. debt is not an real issue to baba. **very important note is that comparing baba to other big techs valuations at the moment proves that baba is dirty cheap and can be a good short/long term play . even is market goes sideways i dont see baba going any lower than right now. 200 price is pretty strong ressitence and still a good price. revenue growth: 47.96% eps growth : 14.42% i will be including a look into baba Assets and Liabilities, which i believe is showing us a healthy company which keep growing and expanding and inceasing their cashflow, revenue and shareholders equity. Liabilities:   Assets:    Profitability in baba business is quite larger comparing to peers.   ANALyst reports: most of the ANALysts recommend this stock. various price targets between 260~350 price targets.    alot of big hedgies hold baba, you can check it out. (blackrock, goldman etc)   Technicals: 52wk High: 319.32 52wk Low: 204.39 Avg volume (3M) : 15.8M -> breakout will increase volume obiously everybody watching the stock movement right now. baba is down ~33% from the top at 319.32 (10/27/21). I expect to see a bullish breakout in a couple days, can be happening anytime right now. good support at 209-210 level, every time we get there i can spot large money flowing into baba. I believe that a price of 300$ before the year ends is possible and quite easy with a very little catalyst or sentiment change towards the company. right now from what im reviewing the sentiment towards baba is starting to chagne across the internet and financial market.      I LOVE CARYONS  3x 270$ calls jan22 4x 230$ calls jan22 1x 410$ call jan23 2x 370$ calls jun22 going to add another ~5-8k on farther OTM calls for 3-12month ahead.  "

I own shares of KNBE. KNBE - Everyone is sleeping on this stock and this sector. Sector DD: As in industry insider (systems engineer) I am finding that cybersecurity insurance companies are cracking down on practices and minimum prevention standards. I've seen multiple customers of ours edged into security testing + training by the insurance company telling them its mandatory. The insurers seem to get more strict with every major breach - and we just had a nuclear weapons company breached this week. My investing theory for 2021 is that insurance companies are going to compel massive amounts of cybersecurity spending and produce huge earnings reports.

Most employees are Florida Man / Florida Woman. - 45% rev growth YoY - Turned profitable this year - positive EPS - Financials:  The product: The main product is email phish testing.

They also have awareness training to remediate staff and departments that are falling for the scam emails, or to proactively introduce employees to email security concepts. I did a short trial run with them for a few clients a year ago and was impressed with the platform. I also tried Microsoft's 365 equivalent. Risks: - Not a monopoly. Already other companies in the same security awareness / testing space. - Competitors includes Microsoft - premium Exchange 365 licensing grants a similar but much less developed product amongst other security tools - but minus the remediation training. - The greatest risk from MSFT is that companies may ""already be paying for"" their phish testing tool as part of existing security licenses - similar to business onedrive / sharepoint vs dropbox. - First DD I ever posted so it's probably shit. - Stock already up 60% this week, might correct. tl;dr: Insurance companies are making small/midsize businesses spend money on cybersecurity and getting more strict about payouts.

508,2021-10-18 23:09:35.299112,MSFT,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,,,,"First off this is not financial advice; just my personal opinion on a recent IPO that has a lot of room to run. ZIPRecruiter (ZIP) is undervalued and in the sweet spot of a massive secular trend; my DD has me convinced that this stock could break out. First off, it‚Äôs important to realize that pretty much every employed person in America is considering a job change now that the pandemic is easing up. For the past year and a half, people have stuck it out in terrible jobs mostly because they were happy to have stable employment at the time, and also nobody was hiring. Now that the economy is taking off and companies are trying to hire again, most workers are going to test the waters. Recent estimates from Microsoft are that 40% of US employees will switch companies this year, and other surveys found that at least 26% of workers leave their companies will find new work. Experts are calling it the ‚ÄúGreat Resignation of 2021‚Äù. The numbers are impossible to predict, but just think about all the people in your own friend groups that have been complaining about their jobs for months and are trying to make a change.  So if you agree that the labor markets are unfrozen and people will be taking advantage of it, how can you make money off it? Look at the software companies that will power/enable this big trend. Staffing / recruiting companies that offer this as a service will benefit, but they don‚Äôt scale well. If Manpower Group or Kelley Services has an extra 10 job applicants, they may need to hire an extra recruiter (costs go up as revenues go up). With software platforms, the new job applicants add volume with no incremental costs. The biggest recruiting tool of all is LinkedIn, but that‚Äôs owned by MSFT and is just a sideshow to their main business. Other large software players in the HR Tech space have recruiting tools, such as GOOG, SAP, WDAY, ADP, CDAY, etc ‚Äì but again the recruiting platform is on the periphery of what they do... so not a core competency of any big players. Besides these guys, the market is fragmented. There are thousands of job boards, recruiting firms, talent agencies and staffing companies that will help match applicants to companies, but there is only one standalone software company that focuses on recruiting that is publicly traded: ZIP.  How does ZIP make money and why do they stand out? The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for. And because most jobs are virtual/remote now, this software opens up new roles and opportunities that previously a person wouldn‚Äôt have considered. Now here‚Äôs where it really gets interesting. ZIP went public a few weeks through a direct listing, with no fanfare or hype. Unless you really follow the HR software IPO market, you wouldn‚Äôt even know that this happened. Shares currently trade around $24 and the company has a market cap of $2.5B. ZIP has an EV/Rev ratio of ~9x, which is under the big players above: MSFT = 10x, CDAY = 14x, WDAY = 11x, etc‚Ä¶ meaning it‚Äôs cheaper to buy a share of ZIP than a fully diversified software company that has products in multiple categories. If recruiting is going to grow gangbusters this year as the economy rebounds, how come ZIP is trading at a discount to larger companies that have smaller expected growth rates? I‚Äôm not a professional stock picker, so this is just my speculation, but I think there are 4 reasons why ZIP isn‚Äôt getting any love (yet)  TL/DR ‚Äì ZIP is a stock worth taking a look at; I feel they will fly under the radar until Q2 earnings when they will explode. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, so do you your own research too. I LIKE THE STOCK!! I picked up 1200 shares last week."

Ford and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL are entering a six-year deal that will make the tech giant responsible for much of Ford‚Äôs growing in-vehicle connectivity. This partnership is designed to streamline Ford‚Äôs operations and accelerate an ongoing $11 billion restructuring plan. General Motors: General Motors announced that it plans to invest $27 billion in EV and autonomous vehicles through 2025. The company also mentioned that it plans to release 30 EV models globally by 2025. The company has partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT in leading a $2 billion investment round in self-driving car startup Cruise LLC. Difference: Ford is going with Google and General Motors is going with Microsoft. Google has 14 Automotive startup investments and Acquisitions. Microsoft only has investments in 4 automotive startups. This will help Ford and General Motors in the following areas:  Who wins? In this situation Ford has the better outlook, Google with 14 different Automotive startups to do its project development for Ford, also Google has access to Android and will give Ford the ability to integrate mobile connectivity to their cars. I will keep buying Ford, because of the potential technology integration. Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and none of the above should be construed as financial advice."

Yo2Y makes more sense as I demonstrate here.","Note that I am not a fan of CPI. Inflation was already here a long time ago. So please spare me from using CPI. I am just sick of the media choosing to play easy journalism, in turn, putting so much pressure on ape stocks. BUT, this is a great buying op and here's why. TLDR: CPI %Change number is COVID-biased. The actual number is not high. Inflation is already priced in. Since yesterday all the channels have slammed ape stocks with the CPI data saying its YoY number was ATH since 2008. It's not fair to use YoY numbers because COVID messed up the trajectory of the CPI. The YoY 2019-2020 April number barely changed (from 255.548 to 256.389) It's more appropriate to use Yo2Y number in this case (actually, in many other cases too as broader scope = more smoothened/accurate, less squared error). Think of it this way, without COVID, the number would not have been different than what we have now. The number should still be in the range of 264 - 268. YoY, It's fair to say +4.16% is huge as it has not been this much since 2008 Sep.  YoY However, if we smooth the data with a Yo2Y calculation, an increase of +4.5% over a period of   Yo2Y Please shut the fuck up about CPI. The use of CPI is retarded, but the way it's being brandished is even more retarded. IMO, Inflation has already been priced in as, currently, KO has a higher P/E than AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, BABA by more than 10%. These are not ape stocks, but my point stands as ""value"" stocks are overpriced than these tech stocks. It's important that you know this because stupid journalism is making the price discovery process fucked. Investors flee to safe big cap stocks, making them overvalued. These big cap stocks then use these undeserved overvaluations to:  The list goes on. Peace"

They also provide platforms for developers via Visual Studio Code and Github. A smaller segment of Microsoft are their devices and their games division powered by Xbox.  The healthcare sector is characterized by massive bureaucracy¬†and opportunities for growth. It is one of the rare sectors where real future growth is possible by innovation. Microsoft has established itself as a corporate and industry suite, but now it seems that they are taking their whole Eco-system and moving on the healthcare industry. This is pure speculation, but it can be one of the boldest moves yet, as healthcare facilities, operations, education, training, quality control are large complex systems that can benefit from the tools and services that the company offers. We have seen Microsoft positioning for a certain client type and taking over most of their business. As the opportunities for growth in the corporate sector decrease, Microsoft might just turn to one of the most complex industries with high barriers¬†to entry and large upfront investment costs. On 11 April 2021 they entered into an agreement to acquire Nuance Communications for $ 56 per share, or $19.7 Billion. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (‚ÄúAI‚Äù) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings.¬†This is effectively their foot in the door to the healthcare industry.  I think that the company is trading around its intrinsic value, with potential for growth in the future. There is inflation related market risk that can push down value, but with proper management and pricing flexibility they can at least sustain current value levels. Microsoft solidified the cloud for the corporate & business sector, and decreased the risk of their sales by adopting a continuous subscription model for most of their services. Their business model seems to be growth trough innovation as they are positioning themselves precisely in segments where innovation is lacking and are integrating those segments within their high-barrier to entry, complex systems. -- AZURE:  The backbone of the productivity suite for most of the western corporations Office:  Stabilized revenues for essential business tools Windows 10:  Declining bloatware built upon old architecture LinkedIn:  Well positioned, profitable social network with long-term commuted¬†users Dynamics/Viva:  A major competitor for CRM/ERP market-share¬†with potential for innovation PowerApps:  The future tool for cutting operating expenses and bureaucracy¬†for companies Devices: Uncertain potential for a better experience for Windows users. Augmented reality done right with industry application GitHub, VS Code:  The platforms that will keep MSFT on the cutting edge of development tech Gaming/Xbox: Large but risky potential for growth if the devices and games are improved Microsoft has a wide and complex set of products and services which can be understood as cost cutting tools for businesses, system architecture utilities, productivity and effectiveness tools. They have created a well-thought off interconnected Eco-system that is nothing like the company was even five years ago. It is now apparent that they are well positioned as a market leader for industrial and business applications and will further solidify their position in the future. --Competition-- We are already witnessing the convergence of competitive advantages between the technology titans of Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and it is clear that all of them are fighting for market share in similar technologies and industries. It seems that every company is fighting for their specific industry positioning within technology. For example, Facebook, Microsoft and Google all experiment with Virtual Reality tools such as Google Glass, Oculus Rift and the HoloLens Headset from Microsoft. However MSFT seems to be the most successful as it is positioning for industrial, military and hybrid workspace applications for the headset - the others had less luck in the consumer/gaming sector application of VR. Google, Amazon and Microsoft are likewise competing for cloud dominance, where Amazon AWS is positioning as a cost effective player for developers, MSFT is positioning as a stable and secure platform for companies and Google is positioning as an advanced cutting edge option for new technologies and companies that are able to scale. The last example is between MSFT and GOOGL where they competed for the use of virtual conference apps driven by the new hybrid work culture from the pandemic. Both of the competitors had a variant starting off, MSFT had Skype/Teams, and Google had Hangouts/Meet. It is evident that Microsoft had the right approach with Teams and took over the commercial sector for online communication. Side note, Skype is a drain on the Microsoft brand since the appearance of the pretend close feature. It is irredeemable and should be retired.

Just looking at the growth chart that YOY growth is huge, 2021 I expect will be huge especially if the Medicare age is lowered.    We can also see here, Clover is the fastest-growing medicare company in 2020, simply look at the chart yourself. This rapid growth only accelerates Clovers fuel.    Clover is backed by one of the largest companies in the world, Alphabet or Google.   Something that should be pointed out is that Google's partnering with CLOV could be massive. MSFT is investing heavily in healthcare technology. Both company's market cap is 1T+ (credit to u/sugardaddy for telling me this)   Clover is an innovative disrupting company, its mission is to lower the cost of Medicare plans, Clover sees that the healthcare system is broken as healthcare is expensive. What does Cathie Woods love? Disrupting innovation! I think if Cathie saw this stock she'd definitely buy in!    Clovers growth has been growing rapidly, I do believe 2021 will be a fantastic year for Clover, and maybe report its first profitable quarter.   This photo shows how the Clover Assistant works, basically, an app that can help you make decisions quick (here's an example)  Pretty nice right!     Teladoc currently has a 25 billion market cap with a 10% short float.    Clover has a 3.77 billion market cap, with a 30-40% short interest. Teladoc is nearly 6.6x bigger than Clover, if Clover is even half of Teladoc's market cap, it'd be trading around 4x higher.   Looking at the call options, on the 5/21 expiration, there are a LOT of OI calls for Clover. This makes a Gamma squeeze possible There is still a lot to be covered, this is only a small part. TL;DR: Short + Gamma squeeze possible good company backed by Google fastest medicare growth company + possible medicare age lowered which could give potentially millions of more customers for Clover.

Cost basis will be 2032.08 per share. Max loss defined by trade is 3208 which is the extrinsic value of the trade. This is using PM so the PM calculates the max loss as 3208. At any point in time before contract expiration I can put these shares to someone for 2000 and I would just lose the extrinsic value. So all this said, I would sell covered calls on this. The goal is to make money to a) pay the extrinsic value at which point I'm technically break even because I can put the shares to someone before expiration. Then continue to sell calls to make money. I have the actual cash value to cover the share cost outright so there should not be any margin fees associated with this. One obvious risk is that my shares could get called away at which point I'd be left with a long deep ITM put. The put is still valuable because it covers 100% intrinsic value (a 2000p). My question to anyone is, a) has anyone done this before and b) what am I missing here because it sounds like so long as I don't get called away, and continue selling calls against TSLA while fully protected by the put it is a no brainer right?

Well, it‚Äôs now the largest company in the world. The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant. Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to  And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult! Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE. Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical. I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC. AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.üòÇ INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction. But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals. It‚Äôs supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think). Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely. Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything? If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. (I am not saying you shouldn‚Äôt buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult) As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely. With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter. TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults. Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker."

Lets talk about chips - semiconductors to be exact. If you have tried to purchase a car or refrigerator in the past few months you've noticed that either the price has increased or they are on backorder. Unfortunately, everything from your car's dashboard to your dragon shaped dildo now requires a computer chip. Because of this all this, the semiconductor/chip stocks have been shooting straight up (   So let me lay out the bear case before I start pumping the bull argument. There is a legitimate fear that China will eventually completely control Taiwan and impose the same tariffs that already exist for mainland China. This would drastically hurt business with the West, from which HIMX draws a large portion of it's customer base. Taiwan's position is that as long as they keep making semiconductors, they are important to the West, and we will protect them. At the moment, that's still the case, and looks like that will continue to be the case for the next few years. From a technical aspect this company is being shorted heavily. The put/call ratio is 1.34, the short interest on Aug 13th was 10.35%, and the short ratio everyday since Aug 13th has increased dramatically. So if you think China doesn't plan to start WWIII, please keep reading.

574,2021-10-18 23:15:22.341761,NFLX,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,18.0,u/Lost-Guarantee229,Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate,"There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù. Squid Games has quickly become an international sensation after reaching 111M+ global viewers in more than 200 different countries. Squid games has brought a lot of hype to Netflix (and their original content) and has set the stage for an interesting Q3 2021 earnings report for their stock investors. Today, I am here to predict how Netflix‚Äôs Q3 earnings report will go, and a large part of this will be focusing on the growth of their platform in the past quarter due to their hit show ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù. At the end of this analysis, you will find a   Firstly, as we know, Squid Games had reached over 111M global users in over 200 countries in the past month alone. This in and of itself is impressive, however factoring in their low production cost of $21.4M makes it exponentially more impressive. Squid Games was able to keep these costs low due to filming in South Korea (Internationally) which allows for actors to work longer hours and can bring the cost of production down. Top executives have predicted that the cost to shoot domestically (in Hollywood) would have been 5-10x more than Netflix‚Äôs cost of production. This series in particular has opened the floodgates for streaming services to shoot internationally, as many of them are now starting to express interest in it. Squid Games was a huge money maker for Netflix and has been estimated to be worth in the ballpark of $900M, which represents a return on their investment (production) of over 4,100%. Considering Netflix‚Äôs revenues last quarter were $7.3B, Squid Games is likely to represent a large percentage of their revenues in Q3, and since their margins are so impressive, it is likely that we see Squid Games have a role to play in Netflix having better margins on their upcoming earnings.  The most important factor that I derived from Netflix‚Äôs Q2 2021 financial report is the fact that their weighted average subscription price across all of their regions is $12.26. This will be very important in determining the revenues in Q3 2021. Furthermore, Netflix‚Äôs revenues in Q2 2021 were $7.34B, and their cost of revenues was $4.02B (54.73% of revenues).   I am basing Netflix‚Äôs revenues off of their previous revenues, plus the new revenues that are brought in by additional subscribers in this quarter. Firstly, to get the new subscriber figures I decided to take Netflix‚Äôs estimate of 3.5M in this quarter for the first 3 months, due to squid games not being added. This resulted in 900k new subscribers per month for the first 3 months, which adds up to 2.7M new subscribers in June, July, and August. Lastly, we needed the new subscribers for the month of September. This was more difficult to calculate as they released Squid Games this month which drove in far more traffic than usual. In order to get a proxy for how many new subscribers a ‚Äúhit‚Äù like Squid Games can bring in, I used the data from Netflix‚Äôs 2nd biggest show ‚ÄúBridgerton.‚Äù Like Squid Games, Bridgerton was released 1 month prior to their earnings report, and helped Netflix to beat their new subscriber estimates by 41%. However, since squid games is 50% more popular than Bridgerton was in their first month, I think it is reasonable to estimate that Squid Games can help Netflix beat their Q3 2021 new subscriber estimates by 61.5%. Increasing Netflix‚Äôs Q3 subscriber figures yield 5.65M new subscribers over the whole quarter. This means that in September, Netflix likely brought in 2.95M new subscribers mostly off of the success of Squid Games. Overall, if Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers June, their revenue generated for the quarter would be $44.32M (900000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in July, their revenues generated for the quarter would be $33.1M (900,000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in August, their revenues for the quarter would be $22.07M (900,000*$12.26*2 months). Lastly, if Netflix brought in 2.95M subscribers in September as a result of Squid Games, their quarterly revenues would be $36.16M. In total, it is reasonable to assume Netflix increased their revenues by $136.22M, bringing their Q3 revenues to $7.48B. However, Netflix has been reported to have increased their prices by $1 in many regions. To be conservative, we can assume a $0.50 increase across all regions, which would result in a 4% increase on average prices. This would then cause Netflix‚Äôs quarterly revenues to be 4% higher, totalling $7.78B. This would represent earnings beat of 0.28B (or 3.7%).  As previously mentioned, Squid Games is very likely to have increased Netflix‚Äôs margins. As a result of this we can conservatively estimate that Netflix‚Äôs cost of revenues is 54% of their revenues (as opposed to 54.73% in Q2 2021). By doing this their cost of revenues should be $4.2B  Assuming that Netflix‚Äôs other costs are the same % of revenues as they were in the previous quarter, we can estimate all of these other expenses to total $1.56B.  If these assumptions are correct, then Netflix‚Äôs operating income for Q3 2021 should be $2.01B.  Assuming Netflix‚Äôs Net Income to Operating Income ratio is the same (over the past 6 months), we can estimate that Netflix‚Äôs Q3 Net Income figure to be $1.25B.  Since Netflix has 442.6M shares outstanding, their diluted EPS should be $2.74. This would represent a 7% EPS  I think that Netflix is going to narrowly beat earnings, which in theory should be good for the stock. However, since Squid Games was released, the stock has been up 6-7%. As a result, I think that NFLX will not have a big reaction from their earnings. I think that they might open the next trading day (October 20th) up between 0-1% and close the day between -0.5% and +0.5%. If I am correct, then the best way that I could think to play this via iron condors. I think that a 600/615/635/650 iron condor would be suitable given "

Although Pluto TV is considerably smaller than Roku, it is growing faster and is forecasted to surpass Roku's active users this year. Streaming subscribers are also growing at a high rate, ViacomCBS added 12M subscribers in the first half of the year and reached 42M global subscribers. The decline in traditional TV viewing is a headwind, but growth in streaming and Pluto TV will more than compensate for it. A conservative DCF Model gives us a fair value of $65.79 per share, 58.5% above the current price of $41.50. The entire traditional media industry is in a difficult transformational period, with consumers shifting away from traditional TV to streaming, companies are being forced to adapt or slowly wither away. ViacomCBS (VIAC) is no different, even though the merger put it in a much stronger position to compete in streaming, it still faces a few difficult years ahead. As revenues from traditional TV ads and subscribers inevitably fall, growth from streaming subscriptions and Pluto TV will be essential to offset this fall. Streaming revenues are forecasted to be $4.3 billion this year, 15% of total revenues, with a growth of 67% y-o-y, far ahead of the initial guidance given by management. Source: 2020 Q4 earnings presentation ViacomCBS Pluto TV has proven to be a key asset and an invaluable acquisition. As linear TV ad spending shifts to connected TV, Pluto TV stands to capture a sizable share of the market with its fast-growing user base. The company has already grown from $70 million in revenue in 2018 to over $1 billion expected in 2021, more than doubling revenues for four consecutive quarters. Streaming subscriptions have not been slacking either. After rebranding CBS All Access to Paramount+ last March, ViacomCBS added 12M subscribers in the first half of 2021, and with a Paramount+ planned launch in Europe in 2022, the segment is forecasted to experience outstanding growth in the following years.  Pluto TV active users Source: 2020 Q4 earnings presentation ViacomCBS Viacom acquired the company for $340 million in January 2019. Since then, Pluto TV has quintupled its active users and more than tripled its ARPU with no signs of stopping. Although ViacomCBS does not report revenues separately for Pluto TV, CEO Bob Bakish commented in the latest earnings call: ""we now, in fact, expect Pluto TV to comfortably generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year."" Applying the current 2021 ~x18 sales multiple of Roku to Pluto TV gives us a valuation of at least $18 billion. At the current price of $41.50 per share, VIAC is worth ~$27 billion and has ~$12.3 billion in net debt, for a total enterprise value of ~$39.3 billion. While the multiples of Roku may be deemed to be too high by some, it is what the market is currently valuing it at. I am using the same multiples since both companies are in the same industry and Pluto TV is actually growing faster. In 2021 Q2, Pluto's revenue grew 169% while Roku's platform revenue grew 117%. In addition, if we remove the hardware revenue component from Roku, which has negative margins, Roku is trading at ~23x times 2021 platform revenue, giving us a valuation of at least $23 billion for Pluto TV. Pluto's revenue grew 169% in the quarter. This tremendous expansion of the business has been driven by growth in users‚Äô engagement and sell through. Domestic watch time per MAU increased 45% year-over-year in Q2, and Pluto TV domestic ARPU more than doubled year-over-year Source: 2021 Q2 earnings call transcript ViacomCBS Active users comparison Millions of active users Pluto TV.

ViacomCBS streaming subscribers Source: 2020 Q4 earnings presentation ViacomCBS The recently announced partnership with Sky to launch Paramount+ in Europe in 2022 will also considerably boost subscriber growth. Analysts have already increased their subscribers' forecast and are now expecting 66M subscribers by the end of 2022. At this rate, we could see 80M subscribers by the end of 2023. Streaming subscriptions revenue is on track to reach close to $2 billion in revenue this year (70% y-o-y growth), and this does not include the advertising revenue from the ad-supported Paramount+ subscription. This is quite small compared to giants like Netflix, but its fast growth will be more than enough to offset the decline in revenue from the traditional business. Traditional Business When thinking about the traditional business, two things come to mind: secular decline and cannibalization. As consumers continue to move away from linear TV; advertising, affiliate, and licensing revenues will inevitably fall. The next few years will be especially hard for earnings growth as ViacomCBS has to increase its spending to grow its streaming business, adding pressure to margins. Source: 2021 Q2 Trending Schedules ViacomCBS Some investors might be rightfully concerned that streaming will simply replace the current linear TV revenues with lower margins as consumers just shift from one platform to another. ViacomCBS' management recently put those concerns to rest as it claimed that streaming will lead to both higher ARPUs and user reach. Streaming presents a compelling market opportunity for two key reasons; one, unit upside where streaming allows for a greater addressable base of viewers go linear and two, ARPU upside because streaming ARPU's have a more compelling long-term trajectory than linear. The unit upside is especially true internationally where streaming allows us to reach beyond the Pay TV universe, which has limited penetration in many international markets. Source: 2021 Q1 earnings call transcript ViacomCBS The traditional business may be in decline, but it still has revenues comparable to those of Netflix, which will allow ViacomCBS to compete in content spending as its streaming business matures. Using a DCF Model to value ViacomCBS Current analyst estimates guide for flat operating income, flat free cash flow, and revenue growth of ~3% until 2023. After 2023, I am forecasting that ViacomCBS will start to temper its investment in content and start growing free cash flow again, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 3%. Here are the assumptions of the model: Operating expenses will remain as 22.5% of revenues, this is consistent with the average of the last three years. Content expenses will grow so that operating income and free cash flow remain flat until 2023. After 2023, content spending will start to slow down. For reference, changing the terminal EBIT growth rate would give us the following values per share: 0% growth: $40.07 1% growth: $46.34 2% growth: $54.55 4% growth: $82.09 5% growth: $107.88 As you can see, ViacomCBS is currently being priced like a company that will never grow its earnings. While I do agree that the next 3-5 years will likely see no or little earnings growth as the bulk of the transition to streaming takes place, I find it highly improbable that earnings will remain stagnant forever. Conclusion The market is not recognizing ViacomCBS' true value. The focus on short-term earnings pressure is overshadowing the long-term growth that will come from Pluto TV and streaming. Paramount+ is growing considerably faster than initially expected and Pluto TV has a leadership position in the high-growth connected TV market. ViacomCBS is a buy for the long-term, as it is the most undervalued media entertainment company in the market. The next 3-5 years will be a transition period with flat earnings growth, but the investment in streaming will pay off and generate strong returns for long-term-oriented investors."

I figured it might be interesting to plot subscriber count evolution for both streaming services, assuming constant growth rate (based on last Y-o-Y or Q-o-Q growth). Based on current YoY growth Paramount+ could surpass Netflix sVoD by Q2 2024. If last quarter growth is sustained it might even catch up before the end of 2023 with approx 224 mio subscribers.     I realize this is not a fair comparison since Paramount+ actually has accelerating growth while Netflix seems to be close to its peak now. The outlook is actually even better. Point I am trying to make is...the current PE ratio of ""value stock"" ViacomCBS (9.2) vs Netflix (54.4) makes no sense imho given it's currently outpacing Netflix in growth.

As some of you already know, VIAC flew 7% today after a fantastic earnings report that blew the doors off nearly every metric. I know what you're thinking: welp, missed the boat on another one. And yes everyone, I'm the guy who posted the  But this party is literally just getting started. On Monday, Discovery (DISCA)    Ok let's review what Viacom even does for those who don't know. If you do know, skip this next part.    If you haven't watched something made by one of these brands there's just simply no way you live in America.  Viacom basically owns every single TV channel you retards grew up watching. Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, Comedy Central - from our childhood cartoons at Nickelodeon to the greatest comedy sketch show of all time (Chapelle's Show - no debate) to the shitty reality shows of the 2000's (Jersey Shore): Viacom owns ALL of it. It also owns Showtime which makes Billions, the unofficial TV show of WSB. In a day and age where streaming content is at a premium, Viacom is sitting on an absolute TREASURE CHEST of content.    Even total retards know that traditional TV as we know is dying. Gone are the days where the whole family gathers around the tube to watch Modern Family at 9pm - these days everyone is on their own schedule, they mostly get their shows through streaming apps when they want it. More and more families are cutting the cable cord, opting instead to go with streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon - with varying degrees of success. Streaming is the future - nothing new here. Paramount+ is the brand spanking new streaming app that Viacom is banking on to contend with the big boys. The market has basically valued this venture at fucking zero - and you know what that was somewhat understandable: it's a crowded industry, the app hadn't existed for even a full quarter yet, the street wanted to take a ""wait and see"" approach. Welp, Paramount just blew the fucking doors off all projections for their first full quarter and put to rest any doubts about the viability of the app. Between Paramount (and premium cable sister app Showtime), Viacom now has 42 million users, up from 36 when they last reported. And the biggest catalysts for growth are still yet to come! Anyways, back to live TV's alleged slow death. There is one MAJOR exception to this. Sports. While we can catch our Billions episode on Tuesday night because we missed it Sunday and have basically the same experience, there is nothing more useless than a rerun of a sporting event. We need that shit LIVE, and it's basically the only kind of TV that has to be.  Did you know that the NFL accounted for 71 of the top 100 most watched live broadcasts in 2020? That's almost 75 fucking percent! In fact the NFL was responsible for $4 billion+ ad revenue for host networks in 2020 - and guess who just extended their NFL deal? When fall rolls around, P+ signups are going to fucking FLY as the CBS team broadcasts every AFC matchup this year, conveniently located in some top TV markets - Kansas City, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and New England are all AFC / ViacomCBS territory, and all happy to look pretty decent this year unlike NFC teams New Orleans, Atlanta, and Chicago (but i'll save this convo for  Oh yeah, ViacomCBS also has the SEC college football rights too, the only conference in college football that even matters these days. American Football not your thing? They got the rights to real futbol too, including UEFA Champions league soccer and Serie A. More of a hoops guy? Guess who has the exclusive rights to March Madness. More of a boomer? Guess who has the PGA Tour. With over 1000 live sporting events a year, Paramount Plus may actually be the most complete sports streaming app out there, surpassing even ESPN.  If you're reading this, take a moment to wipe the jizz off your pants from Viacom's sporting dominance as we review their more traditional businesses and check out some of these stats.   Wait, you mean to tell me ONE company has the top THREE dramas, top SIX comedies, #1 news show, and the #1 most watched show in the country on TOP of the NFL, SEC, PGA, NCAA, and soccer?! Even if you're not big on this stuff, you have to recognize how impressive that is. I for one don't watch a single one of these shows, but I know a lot of middle America / boomer generation absolutely still live by this shit. They aren't going away any time soon, as much as we might want them to.  Don't believe this? Check out   I'm assuming none of us watch any of these shows anymore unless it's to find new memes for WSB, but we all have a son / daugher / stepson as product of cuckery / sibling who is right in the Spongebob / Paw Patrol / Peppa Pig age range. No one, not even Disney, controls THIS much essential IP for the children's market. For parents, Paramount+ isn't a luxury, it's an absolute NECESSITY to shut their kids up.   The order isn't specified, but out of the  Alright, enough about Paramount Plus. It's the key to VIAC's future, but we've covered enough of it.

Whether or not you buy the stock, if you wasted all this time reading through all of this you will have at least gained the knowledge of the single greatest free cord cutting app ever invented.   But how does Viacom make any money by giving you hundreds of channels and not charging you? You guessed it: ads. This nifty free app is expected to generate    2.     Contrary to popular belief, the SVOD pie is still growing even as we come out of the pandemic, and Viacom's share (through Showtime and Paramount+, one of the only apps above to actually GAIN market share TWO straight quarters) is expanding as well. Notice the 4% DECLINE from Netflix between Q4 and Q2 2021 while Hulu and Disney have actually SHRANK as well. Time for a new sheriff in town?  Those of you who thought Netflix runs this shit like Don Corleone are severely mistaken. While an early entrant and pioneer in the streaming space, growth has been hard to come by for Netflix thanks to a declining library, a refusal to compete in live sports or news programs, and more recently, a truly   You're probably most familiar with HBO as the channel that fucked up Game of Thrones beyond repair, rendering a once global cultural phenomenon to being completely wiped out from the entire pop-culture consciousness. Discovery makes all the dogshit reality TV such as 90 Day Fiancee that is tearing down the fabric of American society. Other assets include TNT (home of Charles Barkley and I really don't know what else) and CNN (the world's leading purveyor of fake news). Welp, they're all joining together. As of  I'm not going to bash Discovery too much because I do think it has a chance to be relevant down the line, but this merger isn't closing for a WHILE and there's just not a whole lot of upside for the stock in the short term. The potential of being acquired is now gone.  Disney has deep pockets, and Disney+ combined with Hulu and ESPN is a strong portfolio. Their dual theatrical release + Disney+ streaming release combo business model is also used by Paramount, and may prove to be the standard moving forward. Disney+ has two of the world's most valuable IP of all time in Marvel and Star Wars, so you won't catch me talking shit about them here. They're a strong player here, and is the only one that could challenge Viacom's supremacy in children's content (although IMO Paramount targets the 5+ demographic while Disney is more in the 13+ space). Then again, Disney isn't a pure play streaming stock either (Disney World, Disney Land) so it's not a perfect comparison.  Both of these FAANG stalwarts have made half assed efforts to compete in the streaming space without really dedicating any sort of resources to it since they have so much other shit going on. Bezos at least pretended to care for a while, showing up to the Emmy awards and shit before getting bored and fucking off to space. Apple's AppleTV effort has been dismal to say the least, with a content library of around 50 titles and a userbase composed almost entirely of free trials that won't be renewed. More on this later.     Ok, I compiled the above myself and did my best to update through this quarter's ER's. It may not be ENTIRELY up to date or accurate, but I did the best I could since as far as I could tell there was nowhere else on the internet that had this info all in one place, I looked everywhere. Does not include Pluto TV, Tubi, Roku, or any of the free ad-based apps.   Ok, let's talk numbers, without which this is just paragraphs of drivel that no one is going to fucking read. If you apes made it this far by the way, I salute you. Here's where it gets fun. The below is sourced from a Google sheets template I built from scatch, sourcing from Google Finance and Finviz. I'll point out what I thought was noteworthy from each screen, but feel free to draw your own conclusions.   Check out that 52 week high column for Viacom and Discovery vs. where they are now. If you know the Bill Hwang story, you know what happened. If you don't, scroll down for a recap. This stock can get back there, we've seen it happen.   Viacom's RSI yesterday was 34 before today's ER, while it's still basically trading below all three SMA's. While these numbers are terrible, you'll see they pretty much suck across the entire sector (check out the SMA stats on the streaming ETF). It's a downtime for the streaming sector coming out of the pandemic with money flowing towards reopening plays, while high growth tech has been mooning thanks to a second collapse of the 10 year yield. I expect this entire sector to recover H2 2021 via sector rotation back into communications when the 10 year yield goes back up (it's projected to double by year end).    The important thing to note here is institutional onwership aka ""the smart money"". Viacom is a whopping 85+% institutionally owned - asset managers, banks, hedge funds, pension funds, you name it. The short float number isn't high so I'm not going to lie to you about short squeeze potential. You'd have to be retarded to short here at 41 rather than back at 100 anyways.      Yes you are reading this correctly - Viacom trades at a paltry 9 P/E and just 1 times revneue!!! Even compared to its peers in traditional TV, this is ludicrously low. Why should FOXA be higher despite not having a paid streaming app? Why does ROKU deserve to trade at a whopping 239 P/E and Netflix at 54 P/E? I'm not arguing that VIAC should be anywhere near those P/E's, but with everything it has going for it, 9 is ludicrous. You're not going to find better-hidden value than this ANYWHERE in the S&P 500. Run a screen and sort by P/E if you don't believe me.  I don't want to spend too much time on this story because all of WSB knows it for the most part. Legendary fund manager Bill Hwang blew up his account in a matter of days in true WSB fashion by being levered 20 to 1 in names such as Viacom, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music, IQiYi, and other assorted hilarity. With the bath that Chinese stonks have taken lately and the precipitous fall from 100 to as low as 38 in Viacom, it's easy to dismiss good old billy boy as just another retard in over his head. But this guy saw something in Viacom. Instead of telling the entire Archegos story, i'll lay out the sequence of events as relates specifically to VIAC's share price.  A lot of times, retards throw out random price targets that stocks will never hit in their entire existence. Here, we already know what VIAC is capable of. Sure it took a 20-1 levered Korean fund to get us there, but this glimpse to the past is actually a glimpse into our future. I'll hold off on naming an end of year price target myself though, I don't like doing that without building a full model which I just don't have the time for tonight.   This chart would probably be more useful to reflect this week's price action, however since I made this whole thing from scratch it's going to take too long so fuck it. As you can see, streaming stocks have mostly all taken a breather since March. Getting in now is a classic buy low situation, something us apes really need to start trying for a change.    WSB might be composed of a bunch of retards that barely know how the market work, but everyone knows this: if you own stock or options in a company and it gets bought out, it is the FASTEST and most satisfying path to tendies. Strategic acquisitions are known to pay a  At least that's how Discovery shareholders felt the morning of May 17th before  But while DISCA owners were left holding their dick's, a world of possibilities were opened up for the remaining players in the streaming space to be acquired by the giants. Shortly after Amazon acquired the private MGM studios, which basically only has James Bond at this point. Much speculation ensued about whether the remaining players (VIAC, Lionsgate, AMCX, CURI) would be acquired by the giants of Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney etc. I'm not going to sit here and lie to everyone and say a merger is imminent, I have no fucking clue.

With earnings this good, we're already starting to see upgrades TODAY from analysts who weren't too lazy to pass in their work by EOD.   Bank of America also has a 53 PT from last quarter. I would expect further upgrades from the rest of the street tomorrow.  Even Without accounting for the new upgrades from today or tomorrow, the average VIAC price target is still $50.34, representing a 21% upside.  I wanted to get into some technincal analysis of this thing (cup and fucking handle anyone???) as well as risk factors but I'm out of time, I'll save those for a Part 2. Will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.     ignore the XBI, this was the easiest way to fit it all on one screen since RH still sucks  EDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.  Alright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding. "

(Short DD) $PYPL wants to move beyond just payments. They want top of funnel positioning. This would allow $PYPL to not just be used as a utility (payments) but to also influence a purchase. Quick diversion: $SNAP was (recently) arse fucked (in part) due to $AAPL changing the game. What game? Monetization with ads. The App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy. This policy disrupts the collection of data from a customer to be shared with other companies since before you can leverage an identifier for advertisers (IDFA) to help deliver customized advertising from an ad targeting platform. Now, if the customer opts out (which they are more likely to), your ad platform is more useless than it previously was. So what is happening? These companies don‚Äôt necessarily die off. They innovate within the new environment (that comes with new constraints). Part of this innovation would come in the form of super-apps or apps that move away from a wall-garden approach to a content fortress. The difference between ad targeting resulting in a customer moving off site to keeping the customer within a single ecosystem (content fortress). Companies will either support this in-house (e.g., $SNAP developing its own services to become a content fortress), or through Mergers and Acquisitions (e.g., $PYPL acquiring $PINS leveraging $PINS visual discovery platform and predictive Pinterest engine).

Coinbase is in 100+ counties, and they have over 68 million verified users.  Last quarter, Retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) grew to 8.8 million, up 44% from Q1 2021.  Last quarter they had $2.0 billion in net revenue, including $1.9 billion from transactions and $100 million in subscription & services revenue.  Along with being an exchange, $COIN will be a hodler.  In August, they announced plans to purchase $500 million in non-fiat currency and use 10% of their profits to purchase more non-fiat currency in the future.  Think about that - the most popular non-fiat currency was priced under $50K in Aug/Sept and now it is $64K.  That's a massive return on investment. They announced Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever.  They have over 1.8 million users on the waitlist to join. Today!  They announced a partnership with Facebook.  They will be store non-fiat currency for Facebook's new digital wallet, Novi, which will enable users to send and receive money abroad instantly, securely and with no fees. Today!  Coinbase and NBA sign a multiyear partnership deal.  Specifics are not yet revealed.   This company has massive YoY revenue growth, and they have actual earnings.     Concerns - The transactional revenue will eventually get commoditized.  The partnerships/services/other revenue is fast growing and will need to remain so for Coinbase to be sustainable in the long-term.  Think about Vanguard, Fidelity, E-Trade, Charlie Schwab - they all survived the race to zero.  The ability to loan out non-fiat currency is key, and will take time to resolve."

They work through vendors, resellers, independent sales organizations, developers, etc, etc, etc., and have a bunch of different offerings depending on the sector of business, while their projected upward revenue is intense.   Paya has the lowest price per sales of all its competitors at 5.0 (SHOP is at 48.67 and INTU at 16.51). Gross profit margins are insane at 50.9%, compared to 23.2% for Square (SQ), and 48.4% of Paypal (PYPL). In fact, PAYA has the highest Institutional ownership of all competitors and the highest short interest.   competitors: SQ, PYPL, INTU, SHOP, FISV, PSFE  There‚Äôs a lot to deep dive into, but it‚Äôs solid company. So solid that institutions are picking up as many shares of PAYA as possible.  Couple highlights    Since the economy has reopened, PAYA‚Äôs profit margins have only been growing. Unlike most tech companies, they are not a one-and-done situation but will have permanent relevancy in the post-Covid world. In fact, they are a top-20 payment provider in the US.  Part 2: Institutional Holdings: +128%   Okay, so this is getting good. So institutions obviously can‚Äôt hold more than 100% of shares - this is probably a small error in delayed reporting and maybe some brokers miscounting a handful of tranche locked up shares.    What does this mean? It means that institutions and funds think this is a valuable AF company and they are holding nearly all outstanding shares. They are jacked.  Figuring out just how small the float is relevant to figuring out what kind of corner shorts have put themselves in. Luckily we have some good pieces of info to guide us-     After all my time in highly illiquid stocks like NEGG and others that can‚Äôt be named, it‚Äôs obvious PAYA‚Äôs float is super tight, and it seems pretty plausible institutional holdings are likely around the 90% range, if not higher.  Additionally, from the FTD viewpoint you see a spike in  These shorts don‚Äôt realize that their positions are ticking time bombs due to the illiquid nature of the stock. They probably don‚Äôt even have a fundamentally negative view of the company and are just actively trading in and out of the stock. Spoiler: it won‚Äôt end well Part 3: Canceled. Warrant dilution A lot of negative price sentiment came from market pricing in an 18mil eventual share dilution via warrant exercises. This would have been a -  Turns out PAYA is doing well enough that they are  For those unfamiliar with the process here, I‚Äôll explain. Since PAYA was originally a SPAC, it has warrants. A warrant is basically a call option with a strike price of $11.50 and a 5 year term.  This is bullish because    Part 4: The Short and Long Play  There is still an immediate need for the market to react to the warrant redemption. Upside is at least 11% - from current $10.21 to $11.33 just on the news Friday alone (PSA - the options market has not priced this in at all yet) not even factoring in their massive revenue guidance, short coverings, or other catalysts they have lined up.      Part 5: TA  The arrows are a RSI oversold indicator, and it looks like earnings FUD is over -- repeating the pattern of a rebound it showed in the last earnings. Actually, if you expand to the March 8th earnings you will see the same pattern. Part 6: Option Flow Below is a graphic from an external site that summarizes option flow. It's filtered on the last 50k orders with premium greater than or equal to 1k.  Just based on the flow and ignoring everything else we have extremely bullish premiums,  the ask side is outperforming the bid side,  with the stock showing an overall bullish sentiment going forward.   Flow as of Aug 13, 2021 I also looked back in time at historical option flow to see when  10k OI for the Aug 10p was opened, since someone pointed out to me that this OI looked suspect af. So, i found that the Aug 10p  were opened  on March 8th and 9th, and they were met with 10k calls for the Aug 15c at the same time. It seems this action corresponds to a  spread trade that was opened after PAYA's March 8th earnings. There were also 1k Nov 12.5c  calls bought on Friday at the ask (not by me) at a price of 0.45. This explains my position, I just followed the dude/dude'et into the November's after seeing the price was in a tight consolidation intra-day. Looking back in history:  These large purchases typically account for most of the option volume for the entire day across all strikes and maturities, and you can see that a good chunk of OI was opened up in the most recent weeks. So, unless it one of you fucks, I'm thinking someone is playing on some inside information or is simply a degenerate (like me). Hence, big dick energy.

Massive market crash is incoming next week and it‚Äôs going to be worse than the 2008 housing crash! üìâüí•,"Now that I got your attention, I‚Äôm thinking there is going to be a (possibly major) correction mid-way next week.  FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly. Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It‚Äôs unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.  TA says we‚Äôre reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).  Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1% from here at $370~$371 EWT says we‚Äôre reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance. Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.   The stars have aligned for a (bigly) drop. Position: QQQ 361p 08/06"

I sell music and books, primarily, and use PayPal checkout. Today PayPal just sent out their new price increases for August 2nd, and the number hikes are unnecessary and much higher than Square, their main competitor. For example, a credit card payment with Square carries fees of $0.10 plus 2.6% of the transaction amount. The online fee is $0.30 plus 2.9%. If you manually key in a credit card, it jumps to $0.15 plus 3.5%, which feels dumb until you consider why a card might not scan, and this is insurance on those transactions. PayPal was competitive at $0.30 plus 2.9% per transaction, regardless if keyed in or run. PayPal is now increasing their cut to $0.49 plus 3.49% per transaction, a 0.5% plus $0.19 hike. That may not sound like much, but over thousands of transactions, that's a ton of money I'm losing on fees. So I have to spend the weekend dropping new codes into purchase buttons...and those buttons will lead to Square. As an investor, you might think more fees means more money for PayPal, but I promise you that in talking with other small business owners, we're acutely aware of that bottom line, and I've had many discussions on the merits of PayPal vs Square at major book and music conferences each year. Think about every small-time online retailer...they're going to vote with their pocketbook. So there you have it. Think about getting some money on the Square train, as that shit might pop.

601,2021-04-29 23:16:36.537772,PYPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,122.0,u/vegancash,"$PSFE (Paysafe): A better way to bet on multiple high growth companies like DRAFTKINGS, BARSTOOL (PENN), FORTNITE (Epic Game), YOUTUBE/GOOGLE, COINBASE, ROBLOX, TWITCH (AMAZON), SKILLZ, APPLEPAY, BetMGM (MGM), FANDUEL, SPOTIFY, MICROSOFT/XBOX, etc."," Paysafe Partners Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers/partners like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing e-currencies which is growing in popularity. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:  (the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe valuation in-depth and discussion of bear cases, so I‚Äôm not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.) Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don‚Äôt even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it‚Äôs really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards. But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it‚Äôs more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential. Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:  As you can see these Paysafe‚Äôs customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11). Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer‚Äôs earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe‚Äôs future growth:  Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation: Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) ‚Äú Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv‚Äù (source:  Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) ‚ÄúSquare reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.‚Äù ( source:  So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don‚Äôt know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ ~$100 Billion. I get it, people will say look man their CAGR is way too small compare to PayPal or SQ. I'm not looking at the past. I'm looking at the future. Their CAGR estimate did not include the sportbetting/igaming growth. Remember that Sportbetting was banned in the USA but has been overturned by the SCOTUS recently. Right now less than 1/2 the population can bet online, and the 4 largest states haven't yet legalized online gaming. This is why I post the results from their customers like DKNG and PENN which is showing high growth rate. And best of all? They own this space in online gambling as they are a monopoly. So we'll see what their new CAGR will be going forward once they reported earning tomorrow (May 11). If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation. Paysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, e-wallet/currencies which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I‚Äôll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I‚Äôm investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential. Summary: Paysafe I believed is a lower risk and high reward stock, since their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when 20+ states including the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth (as seen with DKNG, PENN, MGM 1st qtr report) area and they owns it. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play. Disclaimer: I own Paysafe commons, warrants, and option calls. I am not a financial adviser.

602,2021-04-29 23:16:39.099495,PYPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,652.0,u/NrdRage,"NrdRage's Friday DD: I promised you a layup, so here you go. It's inevitable, so I for one welcome our new Chinese overlord Chairman XiMao. The company who will sell you everything except freedom and independence. $BABA-Booey","So y'all have been asking for an  easy, can't-possibly-fuck-it-up type of trade, especially after the  $ISRG debacle.  I don't usually like writing up about companies with  more than half-trillion dollar market caps, but I'll make an exception  just this once because it doesn't get any easier than this trade,  especially with our newfound policy of kissing China's feet rather than  trying to piss them off.  So let's talk about Alibaba ($BABA) Who they are, in case you've been living under a rock $BABA  is basically the result of if you combined $AMZN, $JPM, $SHOP, $PYPL,  and $GOOG (not $GOOGL, no voting rights in China).  Over 90% of China's  online shopping goes through one of their portals, mostly Taobao on the  consumer side and the flagship Alibaba site for B2B.  Oh, and they've  even started building out their own cloud platform, because China can  never just come up with an idea on their own, they have to copy a  competitor (i.e. Amazon).  If you think Amazon is pervasive, they're  bush league compared to this company.  In short, the only thing bigger  than China's $BABA is deceased WWF pornstar Chyna's clit (still too  soon?). Anecdotally,  they're also where savvy US consumers go to buy $1500 DJI Phantom 4  drones for like 400 bucks (and no, they're not knockoffs).  Peering over the Great Wall:  Their over 600 billion dollar market  cap makes them the 7th largest company on the exchange, just behind  $TSLA and just above Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.  Unlike the  company just ahead of them, they actually make money, though.  They do  about 72 billion dollars in revenue annually and, when they're not  pissing off the communist party and being handed down massive fines as  an alternative to their founder being disappeared to go hang out with  the Uyghurs in a slave camp making textiles, they pocket about 12  billion of that 72 as net revenue.  They make their money by selling ad  space to merchants as opposed to $AMZN's method of ""taking 1/3 of all  the money you make for giving you a buy button on the site"" and, as  recently as 2019, had grand designs about moving in to the US space and  taking on $AMZN head-on with a merchant agreement of a one-time  admission fee in exchange for commission free commerce.  I could write  an entire thesis just on their various revenue streams.  Everything from  ecommerce to a search engine to their own fucking ( Interestingly,  as a result of their mini argument with the technocommunist leadership  over a failed attempt to IPO the Ant Financial Group, which $BABA owns  1/3 of, $BABA represents one of the few large cap stocks you can trade  in the US that isn't presently sitting near an all-time high (20% off,  in fact), as people - including myself - avoided the company while  waiting to see what China was going to do with them.  Then others have  been apprehensive to jump back into because, apparently, it's more fun  to lose all your money betting on a shitty Chamath scam that rips off  Medicare or a LIDAR company down 97% from its ATH and who makes less  gross revenue in a quarter than I paid for my last car (tragically, I'm  not even joking). As  a result of this depressed price action, $BABA represents something of a  unique animal on Wall Street:  An ultra cap growth stock that is also  technically a value stock.  Just don't tell them they're a unique animal  or else the citizenry will storm their headquarters looking to kill  everyone and eat them because they think it'll bring them luck or make  their dicks bigger.  I usually stay away from this statistic, but for  once it's actually worthwhile to mention:  They only trade at 26 times  forward earnings.  In case you were wondering, $AMZN is more than 3  times that.  So what's their problem?  I've already said:  It's China as a  whole.  All Chinese companies trade at a discount in America for a  number of reasons.  The primary reason is because you can never tell if a  company is actually being honest about its books, its revenues, or if  it's even a company.  For example, longtime followers will know that I  have maintained for quite some time that I'm not positive that the  company ""Same Ole Shit"" is even a real company.  Why?  Because there's  no oversight.  Also, there's no shorting over there, so everybody gets  away with making shit up.  One of the largest companies on their  exchange was found to be 2 guys in a van that parked behind a  hand-pulled noodle shop and who's sum assets were 2 laptops and some web  development software.  This is why, in general, I don't fuck with any  Chinese stocks and only make exceptions for $BABA, $BIDU, and $NIO (and  I'd do $YUMC if not for the fact I ignore that whole sector).   But  mostly, it's because if the regulators across the pond took aim at $BABA  once, there's always a chance they could do it again if Jack Ma forgets  his place.  The 2.8 billion dollar fine they got handed down sounds  really heavy, but it was really a best case scenario for this company.   Had that fine been handed down during any other time than now when the  market is in hard mode, $BABA likely would already be sitting in the  280's right now. So how does the Tendieman come? Expected  47% YOY growth, with strong forward guidance going in to 2022.  Also,  now that President Harris is making nice nice simping for China again,  as soon as we re-open, expect them to start the process of moving in to  the US market, which will both simultaneously decimate Amazon's 3rd  party network while bolstering $BABA's own.  Oh, and they're encroaching  upon Lazada's turf throughout the rest of SE Asia, as well. But  there's a catch:  Because Jack had to go to a re-education camp for a  few months and the company was forced to lay low waiting for Poohbear to  finish throwing his temper tantrum, there's still a bit of a fog into  the company right now that is not likely to be cleared up until they  report their next earnings late May.   Don't worry, I have it on good  authority that $BABA's network of merchants has been able to secure a  reliable supply of child labor to continue making all the goods they  sell.  Some basic TravelCenters of America just because (even though it's not terribly important for the thesis) So  this one is going to look a little different than what I usually put  up, cause I figure some of you are ready for some more advanced  concepts.   As  always, nude line is a 200 day SMA, dark blue is a 50 day SMA, and cyan  is a 20 day EMA.  Red lines represent the wedge that's important for  all of you for the purposes of understanding that it's approaching a  breakout point that is almost 100% to the upside, green represents some  channels that we'll talk about some other time, and the lavender is a  bastard fib fan of strike points based on the action (typically you use  those in a slightly different manner, but that's for another day and  another time.  I'm going to start gradually adding Travelcenters of  America markers in an effort to grow your little minds a bit.  So  consider this a level up.  TL:DR:  Look in the red wedge.  We're  coming up to a head in that pattern, and it will be right around the  time they report earnings.  Look at all the other pretty colors and see  if a wrinkle doesn't develop. One other thing we can look at is price to fair value.  This is a Morningstar chart, I didn't make it myself.     So there are a couple of things I  want to call out here.  One is, obviously, the fact that this stock is  wildly undervalued according to every reasonable metric.  The other one  is a term that I want you guys to start learning called  So, to summarize:  Price Targets: For  once, I actually agree with pretty much every analyst out there.  This  company should be in the 320-330 range, and I think as we enter the 2nd  half of the year, you'll see a strong climb toward that.  How do you play it?  Remember,  it's perfectly fine to let this one sit a bit before entering into a  position, but your cost basis will be roughly the same, regardless.  At  the time of this writing, it's sitting at 235.  If you look at the chart  above, there's a real good chance you can creep in some positions after  it hits 230, because at some point I think it will come in to that  number.  However, if it drives to 230 hard, I want you to let it  consolidate and see if you can't get it even lower - maybe even 224 if  you can catch it on a really bloody red day.  But don't fuck around too  much, this isn't a lot of slippage given the equity price. One  thing people have been asking me periodically is how I would rank the  companies I've talked about thus far on the premise that they don't have  enough powder to be in all the plays and were looking to see if I would  abandon one play for another.  I don't want to encourage that overall  (I don't want to encourage messaging me at all, really), but this once  I'll say that I would definitely not give up my $CLNE or $BE trades for  this one yet, as I don't expect this one to move for a while and those  green plays represent significantly more upside.  I wouldn't give up the  $NVTA trade if I was way underwater on it.  If I wasn't, I might  consider it.  I'd definitely give up cruise ships and plane engines.   Semis in June would be a personal choice.  I'd bail on the Devil's Gold  companies I talk about, I'd bail  on $BB, and the other trades are kind  of dead, anyways.  Position Disclaimers: Some  of you may have seen me talking about how I'm rebalancing my portfolio  for May and exiting out of all but 15 of my long positions in  preparation to enter into 35 short positions due to market conditions  and timing.  $BABA is one of the 15 stocks I do plan on holding my longs  on.  Liquidity in August has been difficult for me to get, so I'm only  sitting on 200 of those, the September 270 is really where I think the  sweet spot is and I've presently got 1900 of them and will be looking to  expand that, I have 2500 October 280's and the November 310 is a long  term FD that I'm sitting on 700 of.  I also have a significant amount of  shares in the company, but I've had them since their IPO and they are  sitting in managed assets, so not relevant to this trade. There you have it, kids.  Go forth, and tendie-ize. All my love -Chad Dickens  Post-script:  Really?  Fucking REALLY?

They went public via spac titled '  The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag. Paysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets. Taking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee. Other notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others. Advantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership.  Finances. PSFE has a market cap of $9.7 Billion. Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice. The market cap/gross profit ratio is 9.7bil/891mil=10.8. At this ratio the company is pretty attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 10.8 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms. PLTR-68 COST-6.3 AAPL-19.1 MCD- 17.1 INTC-6.03 SPOT-27 SQ-42.6 PYPL-31.6 VISA-28.8 Relatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is a bit low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ. Taking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E.  Overall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peers (SQ,PYPL), the company would 3x in valuation. I started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest. Edit: another notable risk I just at thought of for these guys is currency valuations, they do a lot of transferring between currencies as they have a very large international presence. Also fixed market cap # because google is a liar I do not have a position in psfe currently"

Leaked reports, if true will be able to beat AMD at their respective price points. (Of course AMD can always just play price cuts. Additionally, AMD has already showed their new tech V Cache which can supposedly improve peformance by up to 15% over their existing 5k Ryzen series but those will come ETA 1st half 2022.) Intel is also going to release GPUs (which will probably be buggy since its the first time Intel is selling GPUs), but they *claim* they can fight with Nvidia's RTX 3070.  New CEO May be good for intel. He was the ex VMWARE CEO and used to be an Intel employee before. Was mentored by Intel's founder. He tripled VMWare's revenue while he was their CEO from 2012-2021. Intel is also investing heavily into R&D and making new foundries, which is in line with USA's national interest in not being overly reliant on an endangered Taiwan SMC in case China takes over it.  Importantly, Intel just failed their Q3 earnings HORRIBLY (AS EXPECTED from SHITEL) and cut guidance. Their stock crashed from $56 last week to $48 today. The stock is partially beat down (though imo, i think it still could bleed out further. Will pick up more INTC if it drops more.) Expectations for this company has been reduced due to their poor performance.  Why buy these calls instead of the stock? Because there is almost no theta for these calls. $30 strike + $18.15 = $48.15 for a 2023 LEAP. And $40+$8.05 = $48.05 for a 3mths call. Stock is at $48.05 at time of posting.  There is a half decent chance that Intel can do a partial AMD. AMD was a loser that made inferior cpus for 10 years. Intel has been a loser for 2 years. Even being competitive with AMD is an upgrade from being a loser.  TLDR: Intel has positive catalysts in new, competitive CPUs launching on Nov 4. CEO has changed and expectations for the company are reduced, which means it's easier to surprise people."

Well, it‚Äôs now the largest company in the world. The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant. Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to  And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult! Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE. Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical. I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC. AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.üòÇ INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction. But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals. It‚Äôs supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think). Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely. Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything? If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. (I am not saying you shouldn‚Äôt buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult) As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely. With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter. TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults. Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker."

Nervous anticipation of great reporting for #INTC (INTEL)," For more than a year now, the release of Intel's reports has been accompanied by strange stock dynamics. Usually the statements come out either at or above analysts' expectations, but the subsequent dynamics of the quotes can throw any investor out of balance. Since July 2020, the stock has fallen from the reporting date to the low point in the next 6 trading days ranging from -22% to -6.7% and not once has the stock rallied after the reporting date. The secret of such an anomaly lies in the speeches of Intel CEO Patrick P. Gelsinger on the release of the quarterly reports. The man knows how to say the right words and send the stock looking for the bottom. What will happen this time, amid the explosive growth of prices and acute shortage of chips in the world?"

I am drunk and the wife sent me to the couch tonight so why not dabble in some random dd and speculate earnings on AMD  with some hosers like myself.  I am gonna add my 2 cents on AMD. Please keep in mind that I again am not an expert and I have lost money in the best bull market in history. I am degenerate who has been playing weekly‚Äôs on AMD so please let me know your thoughts. I am bullish on AMD. Since last week I gave it an 8% run up till earrings that was on the 12th opened at $104, and we have passed $113 already. Predictions are that AMD will run till earnings dip and then run again. My reasons are as follows. 1.) TSLA earnings on 10/20, AMD chips are used in production of Model S and Model X, TSLA‚Äôs record number of sales in China  is a good indicator, musk tweets about AMD being good to work with on 09/21. I think Elon fucks. Sales of those two models are important as shit could that be another market share for AMD? 2.) APPL cucked INTC today with their new chip. 3.)Still waiting more info on the XILINX deal, 4.)TSM beat expectations 5.)INTC earnings on 10/21 expecting another move on AMD in anticipation of their earnings regardless of the results. 6.)Also need to consider the recent partnerships with Microsoft and Google. Has it all been priced in? I am not sure we have ran over 8% since last week and had a major pop from the new graphics card. I am no expert and I don‚Äôt have enough time to dive into the rabbit hole of semi conductors. This is just speculation and not a reliable source of information but I feel like there are plenty more gains to be had."

This is for its enthusiast grade chip, and I would think they‚Äôd need a beat like this in the server space to have more of an impact on the price.

Also this is just a leak, so it‚Äôs accuracy could be wrong, but a lot of the leaks in the last 2 years with both Intel and AMD have been pretty close. I‚Äôm mostly just a tech enthusiast that keeps track of what‚Äôs new, but I‚Äôve been trading AMD for most of 2020 and 2021 because Intel pretty much has done nothing the last 2 years.

The fatal crash of a NIO ES8 sport-utility vehicle took place last week in China. The SUV is equipped with several driver assistance functions, including features enabled by Intel (ticker: INTC) division Mobileye, that enable some forms of autonomous driving. NIO‚Äôs driver assistance functions are called NIO Pilot and employ cameras as the so-called eyes of the car. NIO has other autonomous-driving technology, referred to as NAD, such as radar, lidar‚Äîa laser-based radar‚Äîand camera vision, as well as computing power provided partly by Nvidia (NVDA) to process all the data points coming at the car. The NAD features don‚Äôt appear to be available on all NIO vehicles, including the ES8. All autonomous driving systems require the driver to pay attention to the road at all times. NIO responded to a request for comment with a Weibo post in Chinese. The post indicates the company is cooperating with police regarding the investigation. The global automotive industry is still wrestling with regulatory and branding issues surrounding autonomous technology. Self-driving features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, make driving safer as long as systems are used as intended. But drivers might rely too much on the features when systems are dubbed pilot or autopilot. Government safety regulators, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are still drafting plans to prepare for the introduction of more advanced self-driving features. Link: "

From under $6 a share to over $90 a share is a huge achievement, especially in this market. As we all know that AMD has been eating away at INTC server market share for a while now. It's about time that things should start getting accelerated, especially how INTC has failed to overcome their challenges with 7nm process etc. AMD's ER is coming up on Tuesday, and I am against playing a binary event. There are simply too many factors in play. For instance, the FOMC meeting is in the same week, J Powell is speaking on Wednesday, which usually means a red day for market before the event. I really think that AMD is long overdue for  a boost to $100+ and it should happen soon after their ER. Any ideas/suggestions how to get maximum benefit out of this without risking it on a binary event like ER? Current position:  Edit: After giving it some thought, I think the best course of action for me would be to buy $100c 8/27e. That would mitigate the risk of FOMC meeting this week and  J. Powell speaking. Given how INTC ER went, it seems like AMD is due for $100+ sooner than later."

The sentiment has been changed to bullish this week, a GREAT TIME TO BUY.","Most great semi stocks are already priced in or overvalued, and we smart experienced apes know that you never buy overvalued stocks because its potential gain is small and its potential loss is too big. Therefore, we need to buy the stock that is undervalued but eventually goes up to meet its price target later because of its strong fundamentals and future growth (which is MU). And why do we need to pick semi stocks for this? Because Semiconductor business is one of the most potential and profitable business in the whole industry; we simply think that everything is turning to digital and AI systems, and all those devices, platforms, and servers need memory chips. Biden's infrastructure bills and his willingness to support semi industry are also tailwinds of semi stocks. Ok, so why MU is the most undervalued stock among all semiconductors now? Because it is ridiculously cheap! 7x forward price to earnings multiple now, and even though it actually have a slowdown in memory chip industry, it is still 10-12x forward earnings which is still ridiculously cheap compared to other semi stocks. (According to Quint Tatro, Joule Financial founder at CNBC). MU's 52 week high is 96.96, and its current price is 72.77. It showed some high volatility and corrections after its ATH because it went up too fast in short time (52 week low is 43.67). The last large correction made MU's price down from 83 to 68.80 which was 17% down in 4 days. This correction happened because of Morgan Stanley's report that says 'winter is coming' for semis. However, all other institutions and investors, including Goldman Sachs, Bofa, Jim Cramer, think that MU is way undervalued, and its price is at the bottom now. Vanguard Group, Sanders Capital, and State Street, top 5 MU shareholders, added MU positions between August 6 to August 16 . Since many institutions and large investors start to buy MU back, its price went up from 68 to 77, and then it dropped to 73 today due to the red market and some sell offs. Reasons why this is a great timing to buy MU now   As you can see, MU is -23.64% from 52 week High on August 25, it has a more discount today since it dropped to 72.77. Ok, then we might doubt about its fundamentals and its future growth. Don't worry, here is why most analysts and institutions think MU is super undervalued and it is time to buy now.  Its FY1 is 12.13 which is already great, but its FY2 and 3 is 6.36 and 6.34 which is too great compared to others. So, it is a great time to buy it before all those number soar later. Their EPS and Revenue growth are also great too (beating all estimates for over 2 years).  3. Morgan Stanley, aka sneaky bitches, revealed a report 'winter is coming' or whatever, saying that DRAM memory chip price was already at the peak and it is going down now which will lead all DRAM company's profit to go down due to its historical data. However, most institutions and investors still believe that DRAM's demand is still too strong enough to cover that DRAM price drop, because all PCs, Servers, Laptops, smartphones, tablets, robots, cars, and anything that has automated computer system needs 'memory chip'. Semi industry has a bright future, and I think Morgan Stanley's report was just a manipulation in order to short the stock and buying it back at discounted price. This asshole bought SK hynix (2nd largest DRAM company) shares back after its correction in Korea. Its price was 120,000 Won before MS's report, and it dropped to 98,000 after its report and they started buying back from 100,000 now. I still strongly believe that this stock will keep going up before tapering. (I hope the Fed does not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole). 4. RSI number is important because we can know if the stock is overbought or not. The current market sentiment is unstable due to upcoming tapering, interest rates, inflation, national debts, infrastructure, etc. and most overbought stock have a high chance to meet its huge corrections later. Ok, so MU's current monthly RSI is 57. It is still in the middle which is a great number for tech growth stock. For example, Nvidia's monthly RSI is 86, AMD's monthly RSI is 85, AMAT is 75, TSM is 76, Qualcomm is 65, and ASML is 93. RSI does not explain everything, but it helps you to know that MU is pretty undervalued. 5. Most great investors always say 'being simple is the best strategy'. I also believe that. Simply, we will make the money if we buy the GOOD stock in cheap way and sell it in expensive way. And simply, MU, a GOOD stock, is cheap now. 6. Here is a better explanation about MU itself (my first MU DD) that shows why MU is a GOOD stock.  There is a high chance that the Fed will not mention about tapering at Jackson Hole meeting because of Delta variant problems and slower than expected economy recovery. If they don't, tech stocks have a higher chance to get pumped for a while, and indeed, undervalued stocks have the highest chance to soar. So I personally strongly believe that few more tailwinds can drive MU price up to 20-30% before its next earnings (Sep 27), and 60-100% in 3-6 months depending on market sentiment. Its current price targets are: Yahoo avg 115.59, Seeking Alpha avg 111.76, Marketwatch avg 115.85, It is simple, but actually not easy. Buy it now since it is turning to bullish, and sell the news before it actually tanks again. If the tapering is coming? Buy the PUTs or wait until the price became cheap again with healthy correction. And then we get in the ride again when it starts pumping again. I think that is how you can survive in this stupid unpredictable market. I sometimes use option straddle strategy during this unpredictable market because all you need to do is choosing high volatility stocks (I might use this strategy for MU later since it has a high volatility, and the current market is unpredictable). My positions: 24 Sep 72c x 7 , 24 Sep 68c x 10, owning 100 shares. Indeed, this is just my DD, no financial advice. Thank you guys."

Anyone who has held Micron who a couple years knows this story. For those who lost their ass on weeklies - this is why I say dont do weeklies on micron. Why is it dumping? Partially because of people getting margin called and closing out their weeklies. STOP DOING IT. So anyway on to the report:  ‚ñ™ Expect CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth to be somewhat above 20%, with DRAM industry supply below demand; there is currently unmet demand for DRAM due to end market strength and we expect the DRAM market to remain tight into CY-22 ‚ñ™ Expect CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the mid 30% range, with NAND supply below demand; we also see the NAND market as tight into CY-22 ‚ñ™ Long-term DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens ‚ñ™ Long-term NAND bit demand growth CAGR of approximately 30% Micron ‚ñ™ Targeting to align our long-term bit supply growth CAGR with the industry bit demand growth CAGR across DRAM and NAND ‚ñ™ CY-21 DRAM and NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth ‚ñ™ Placed orders for multiple EUV tools from ASML as part of long-term agreement ‚ñ™ FY21 Capex revised to somewhat above $9.5 bn; mostly from areas that don‚Äôt impact CY21 and CY22 bit growth such as EUV pre-payments, construction spending and other R&D and corporate items Now during the call, analysts seemed to really dig in deep into Sanjays comments re purchasers shifting from ""just in time"" models to ""just in case"" models. They think this indicates previous purchases were above actual consumption and intended to raise inventory. As such they expect weakening demand and pricing moving forward. I disagree with their fears. Sanjay guides in a way so that he can smash at ER. He has done this for Micron and he has done with Sandisk before they got bought out at WDC. Have a look at previous earnings and whether they beat or not. expand table to see more dates on links below   Sanjay knows markets dont like surprise, so he guides low. Hes also been in Semi industry forever. Hes not an idiot. So when he says guidance is X, I take guidance to be X + extra for the beat. I dont freaking think I need to discount the guidance because purchasers increasing inventory. Sanjay has priced that shit in. So thats inventory and guidance. What about the sale to Texas Instruments? Thats not linked to RAM or NAND really. Kinda but not really. Thats them giving up on (3dx point) Intel Octane. There was no market for it so keeping the plant was costing them 500 mil a year since it was under-utilised. However they kept all the IP from Octane in case it comes back to life later on. Its basically non volatile RAM which can be used as storage - sounds really cool but  I am guessing its expensive AF so people dont want it yet. Again, selling this plant is basically good for micron. We want higher margins to run a slick operation. I dont really like toms hardware but this article explains the sale the best. Other news stories on it say there was a sale but doesnt really tell you much about about the background.  What is driving increasing margin? Well Micron is using DUV (deep ultra violet) with computational lithography and multiple masks to achieve smaller resolution on DRAM. Samsung are achieving same resolution with EUV. EUV costs a bunch and ASML are the only supplier. You should probably get into ASML at some point as well WSB but thats a post for another day. As such, Microns margins for latest tech DRAM is way lower than Samsung. SK Hynix is the third player in RAM and they are playing catchup - seem a bit fucked to me personally. Nanya is the 4th player and realllllly small and think they are just screwed. Dont have the money to get into EUV so next few generations, they will be so far behind they just get bought out if any competition regulatory body allows it (at near bankruptcy stage is my guess). Now Micron is starting to invest in EUV which is good and they have given themselves a lead time for 2 years which feels about right to me. In 2023 we will see if they are still at cutting edge of RAM vs Samsung who will have a 2 year head start into EUV production. This is the only concern to me. In this time, they will gain the benefit of reduced pricing for EUV tech and additional expertise from ASML who will be helping Micron to achieve results. I am hoping they can transplant their specialist know how from DUV to EUV (that everyone else didnt manage to do at this resolution), but at this stage, my science ability is woefully unable to track it meaningfully. Lets look at Microns plan for EUV and the interim releases until then.  So you can see we are currently at 1 alpha node for 10nm in 2021. We have 1 beta and 1 gamma to go planned (still using DUV) before 1 delta which is when EUV should kick in. Thats a new node every year still using DUV. Thats sweet if it works out. In the interim Micron gets to print money like nobodys business (higher margin from DUV) and continue hiring R&D people with EUV knowledge from Korea and Japan. I have a small long position in micron. I dont really care about short term price movements. I expect this to be higher in 3 to 6 months. Thats what I care about. I expect it to be higher in 12 months. Beyond that I want to see how their 1 beta and 1 gamma nodes are coming along with updates as to 1 delta using EUV. We are trading at price levels from Jan/Feb this year. We have had 2 great ERs since then. I dont see TAM in RAM or NAND dropping any time soon or pricing (thesis of tacit collusion as to supply/pricing in oligopolies - we arent cyclical market anymore because 3 market players control like 98% of the DRAM production in the world - its why they are not dumping on capex - its intentional). this is good price to buy, but dont expect results in a week or even a month. We might trade sideways for a while. Shake out the paper hands before funds buy back in at discount and ramp up for next ER. You cant time the ramp up, you just have to be in the stock at a decent price (like now) and then wait for it to happen."
647,2021-06-29 23:19:24.778786,ASML,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,16.0,u/Protoculture_11,MU - earnings upcoming - my views," in about 30 mins from now I have a small long position in micron. May 25 - At JPMorgan Global Technology, Media, and Communications Conference, Micron announed it expects revenue for the quarter to be at or above the high end of the stated guidance range. This is SOP for Sanjay and nice to hear if you have been in Micron for a little while. June 1 - announced volume production of DRAM using Node 1Alpha. This is 14nm but using DUV instead of EUV so its cheaper to make. Samsung and SK Hynix are using EUV for 14nm, but havent seen head to head comparisons yet. Thesis - If this Node 1 alpha process is comparable to Samsung/SK Hynix 14nm stuff, it means higher margin for Micron. It means better guidance moving forward obviously as well. Samsung's former president is in jail which seems to be screwing their business up a bit. Has been steadily losing market share and margin to SK Hynix and Micron. (these are my opinions, no proof etc dont sue me) ""Semi conductors are cyclical"" - yeah but we are deep into tacit collusion now on pricing. We basically going to see ""short supply"" forever. The risk here is not in over supply but in an anti-trust/competition ruling. This is going to be incredibly difficult to find unless someone talks or leaves a smoking gun. These companies arent stupid. Its incredibly easy to enter into tacit collusion because its the reasonable and logical choice but its incredibly difficult to prove. Even if they do prove it, the disgorgement in profits still makes it +EV so it doesnt even matter that much. People are reading Microns reluctance to increase capex as an indication of no confidence in future demand. Thats not the way I see it. This is part of the tacit collusion. They basically get to tell their competitors ""hey, we are not increasing capex that much and you probably shouldnt either unless you wanna stop the gravy train"". Lets extract from their last Q2 report. "" CY-21 DRAM industry bit demand growth of approximately 20%, with DRAM industry supply to be below demand; DRAM market is currently facing a severe undersupply, causing DRAM prices to increase rapidly ... CY-21 NAND industry bit demand growth in the low-to-mid 30% range, with NAND industry supply exceeding demand; more CapEx cuts are needed to allow for healthy NAND industry profitability...Long-term DRAM industry bit demand growth CAGR of mid-to-high teens"" followed by "" CY-21 DRAM & NAND Micron bit supply growth expected to be below industry demand growth...Long-term DRAM & NAND Micron bit supply growth CAGR in line with industry demand growth CAGR...Across DRAM & NAND we target long-term cost reductions in line with industry"" Make of that what you will. Sure seems like a convenient way to say lets all make money together. At the same time its entirely logical and explainable.  Things I want to find out in the call: - Is micron doing R&D into EUV for the next generation? Contracts lined up with ASML for EUV plant since ASML has a backlog? Might be super secret stuff but would be nice to know. - guidance for next quarter and next financial year (obviously). I think this is going to be higher than expected due to the Node 1 alpha mass production assuming it is decent. - Is Micron going to continue spending money on R&D and poaching talent? Seems to be working so far imo.  My thoughts on price - we see a little pop because the high end of guidance is already priced in despite Sanjay always blowing earnings beyond his pre-announcements. Because thats priced in as well. However Micron sometimes sells off post earnings which is incredibly annoying so I dont think weeklies etc are good. Just buy the stock and hold it. Historic PE rations etc are all crap here. We are in a new business model. Its not cyclical anymore."
648,2021-05-29 23:19:27.186745,ASML,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,13.0,u/commodoregoat,$AMAT DD and why semi-conductor stocks are a great play right now,"As usual for me, I took some of my adderall prescription and it drove me to write a DD on my most watched stocks at the moment. Applied Matterials Inc ($AMAT) is a large-cap stock, and I base my play upon it's high quality and strong momentum; as well as confidence in semi-conductor stocks. AMAT provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display and related industries. Applied Materials is the leading producer of equipment and materials for producing microchips, TV's (OLED's/LCD's), and solar panels. They also have their services business which offers manufacturing consulting and automation software. They are based in California, but have factories around the world, with Asian customers accounting for 80% of it's revenue. To summarise:  With the current silicon shortage, I expect the stock to surge further when this shortage slows down.  Why semi-conductor stocks are a good play:  Jim Cramer himself is now looking at AMAT, TSM and AMD. ""Cramer recently said that if investors think chips are truly in short supply and we need capital equipment, then the company they most need is Lam Research (LRCX), other than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)"" ""Jim Cramer recently named chip equipment major Applied Materials (AMAT), as one of the stocks that got away. He called out the bull market in semiconductor equipment. We need to make more chips, he said, and companies like Applied Materials can make that happen. The semiconductor equipment major reported mixed fiscal-second-quarter earnings and received a number of positive reviews and price-target upgrades from Wall Street analysts."" Anyway, aside from Cramer there are many other reasons to own semi-conductor stocks. One of my primary reasons is the growth in data centre demand. This was why I bought NVDA calls at $620, aside from the stock-split. AMD is also bringing out new data-centre GPUs.  I think my adderall has worn off now, but I will update with a part 2 later on. I'm going to open a position in TSMC, AMAT, LCRX, and ASML today. I will look at AMD also."
