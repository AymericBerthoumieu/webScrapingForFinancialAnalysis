At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time. From a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.  There are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day. Another thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play. Tldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider.

As usual the chip shortage still looms over tech companies such as Apple and with the new iPhone 13 release I’m questioning if it was as much of a success and as profitable as the company predicted. I’m not too worried necessarily about the earnings per share, I’m more worried about the outlook of the company for the rest of the year and going into 2022. The majority of Apples iPhone sales occur during the holiday season and I’m not sure if supply will be able to meet the high demand. Personally I feel like there is always the highest jump in iPhone demand every 3 generations due to the general trend of how the average consumer upgrades. Such as with the iPhone 6 to the iPhone X, then to the 13. Apple is amazing and like with many other companies, they have made many advancements and innovations but just haven’t had the chance to benefit from them to the fullest extent financially due to the economic and supply restraints brought along by Covid. The market at the moment is propped up by hope for the future, which I think is fine, it shows that more investors are bullish and in it for the long haul. Therefore I think Apple’s stock might be just fine for earnings and follow suit with the end of the year upward swing of the market even if earnings does not necessarily meet expectations.","Opinions on $AAPLs earnings tomorrow?

Well, it’s now the largest company in the world. The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant. Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to  And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult! Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE. Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical. I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC. AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.😂 INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction. But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals. It’s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think). Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely. Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything? If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. (I am not saying you shouldn’t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult) As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely. With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter. TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults. Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.","The power of cult: Why I think DWAC is primed to move higher and so will other similar cult stocks Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?

2021-10-18 14:21:21.911429,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,153.0,u/Stonkgang_,How To Pick BIG MOVERS 🚀 - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.," The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average “Average daily range” for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it’s shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it’s our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let’s assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip). In both positions we purchase $10,000 worth of stock and risk the low of that opening drive. Due to the news catalyst both stocks move 2x their normal range due to an increase in volume and attention (very common).   Both stocks made the same equivalent move (2 times their daily average) yet example 1 was always the better pick due to it’s potential to provide a far more significant gain. During a swing trade which you may be positioned in for days/weeks the name with the higher ADR is far more likely to provide you with a much better return. Meaning your investment/capital is put to work in a far stronger position. However it’s not simply a case of the higher the better as fundamentals and technicals matter. Some stocks will have a high ADR because they are pumped and dumped on a regular basis. To showcase this let’s take a look at two names with similar ADRs.    2. LM funding . This company has literally no revenue and no growth over the past two years. The daily chart also shows nothing but pump and dumps on a regular basis. This name has a 10.47% ADR.   As you can see, the second example only has a high ADR from high aggressive pumps which are immediately sold into. The graph showcases the previous 2 years of movement. These are the exact names you want to avoid unless you’re a day trader with a short bias.  One of the large misconceptions with beginner traders are that penny stocks provide a better chance of large percentage/monetary gains. More often that not this couldn’t be any further from the truth. For this example we’re going to compare two speculative names to keep things fair. Both names have almost no revenue and are therefore considered as speculative plays.    Since early February 2021 this stock has been in a downtrend with any moves higher being aggressively sold into. The volume has decreased on a weekly and daily basis which tells us there’s very little attention on the name and therefore it’s very unlikely we’ll see any worthwhile movement soon. There is also currently no hype in or surrounding the sector. It’s current stock price is $5.60 and has an ADR of 4.47% 2. Lithium America. Another speculation name which has received quite a lot of attention across social media and amateur traders, however there’s a huge difference. Firstly the chart isn’t trending lower but the complete opposite as it attempts to break into all time highs. Secondly the volume is increasing which shows attention to the name is increasing and therefore a big move is likely (one has recently happened, we traded it). Thirdly there is a large amount of hype in the sector with similar names also being bought and gaining attention. The current price of this stock is $25.43 and the ADR on this stock is 6.73%   So in this example we have two speculative stocks both with little to no revenue. However the Penny stock NNDM has a downtrending chart, no hype, no volume and therefore almost no chance of breaking out.Lithium America on the other hand has a very strong chart, lots of volume, increase hype and therefore a great chance of breaking out. It’s irrelevant if you have $500 to invest or $500,000 as Lithium America in this example on any given day will provide a larger move and better return than NNDM. Not to mention that the likelihood of the move happening on Lithium America is far greater due to the points outlined.  The ADR can also be used to avoid bad entries using the simple mathematics and change of probability. If you’re looking to get into a name which has had no news, no increase in volume and isn’t set to breakout then you’ll want to avoid entering if it’s already close to 1 ADR. Based on averages and the law of probability it’s extremely likely that in that scenario you’ll be entering at the high of the day. The opposite to this is a strong name that’s holding its trend is reaching 1 ADR to the downside. If all other factors look good then the law of probability states you’re likely buying at the low of the day. On aggressive breakouts and large catalysts such as earnings we can use the ADR to determine where we take profits or when we may avoid a late entry. It's not uncommon for large catalysts like a big earnings beat to provide 3-5 ADR's on the first day. You can therefore once again use the data to determine the probability of continuation and a good/bad entry.  We use ADR to filter out the names which have the potential to provide us with a significant move. However they must also have a clean technical chart with some form of growth and/or growth potential. The ADR is the key number to go by Ideally you want to see a minimum of 3% ADR and ideally something within the 5-10% range.","How To Pick BIG MOVERS 🚀 - The Importance of ADR & How To Use It.  The ADR of a stock is calculated using the daily lows and daily highs over a certain period of time to give you an average “Average daily range” for that specific stock. This is usual set at either 10 or 20 days, I personally use the 20 day average for a more accurate representation. This is shown via a percentage basis. The ATR is the same calculation except it’s shown on a dollar basis.   ADR = 5.4% ATR = $0.89   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $SOFI is 5.4% and/or 89 cents.  ADR = 1.8% ATR = $2.74   So in this example the average daily range, the difference between high and lows on $AAPL is 1.8% and/or $2.74 cents.  As traders it’s our job to find stocks which have the potential to make strong moves over a relatively short period of time. To do this we need to focus on names which have the characteristics to make a strong move which can therefore represent a strong gain. In examples 1 & 2 lets take a hypothetical scenario. Let’s assume both names are set up for a breakout and both names have received news of equal weight. our plan for the trade is to buy an opening drive move (buy an opening rip).

2021-10-13 14:21:24.215426,AAPL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,20.0,u/MaybeRocketScience,Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging,"Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off. Would like to share my findings and have opinions on how to play this. The hedge fund in question is  I cannot mention the company, as: - based on quick calculations, they never reached the $1.5B market cap threshold, and are hence (appropriately) qualified per WSB rules as ""worthless securities that are susceptible to scams or pump & dump schemes"". - otherwise every single person on WSB would load up on puts or do whatever shit. Anyway, if you have minimal research skills you'll guess/find what I'm talking about. I'll call it Company X for this post. Company X has no meaningful revenue, and does nothing but lose money. In the management team, there's a guy who recently settled for fraud, for his involvement in another company (which recently collapsed). The stock used to have a total market cap of ~$20M, right now, after massive dilution (5x O/S in a few months), shares are trading higher and the total market cap is ~$650M. Company X has recently engaged in a flurry of M&A, spinoffs and whatever else, creating potential ""catalysts"". It's also heavily promoted by well known Twitter personalities. Not having the cash to fund such endeavors, they started issuing convertible notes. And here Hudson Bay comes into play. The hedge fund offered hundreds of millions $ to Company X in convertible notes with short expiration (note: company revenue ~$2.5M). Other warrants have been offered to them and, to a lesser extent, to other firms. As Company X doesn't make money, but spends a decent bit, they are now asking shareholders to approve early exercise of all warrants.  Very few warrants issued Pointing out that, without that, the company would be in a tough situation (and realistically the M&A activities might be gone):  A little nudge on the vote Hudson Bay Capital would have, including the convertible note, warrants for about 120M shares, which is more than the current O/S total (~100M). Dumping such truckload of shares wouldn't be feasible, with current volumes. Hence, I suspect they are pulling of a magic financial trick called Warrant hedging I know, what the hell is this, who the fuck trades warrants, etc. Warrants are basically call options, but they're issued by the company, hence the money would go straight to them if exercised. Warrant hedging means: - you hold a warrant at $10 - you place a short at $20 - your position is hedged. No matter where the price goes, you locked in a risk free profit. It's also an unsqueezable short, since you can't get margin called. The moment such warrants are exercised, you cash out of your position with $10 in profit, the company cashes in $10 from the warrant, and shareholders are left holding the bag. There are a series of things that make me suspect such strategy is being employed. The first is that the SI has gone nowhere but up lately, despite the supposed ""squeeze"" and the subsequent tanking. It's worth noting that high SI has been recently attracting flocks of retail traders, hoping for squeeze profits. Price action would look manipulated: whenever the share price approaches the warrant level, volume dries up until there's a rebound, often ""catalyst"" triggered. Then huge volume, price goes flat/down, rinse and repeat. HBC can place a de-facto risk free short anytime the price is above the warrants (lowest is $2.655). This leads to a situation in which they could, in principle, short a ton of Company X stock, wake up on the day after the early exercise is approved, and cover their position by exercising their warrants. No messed up price action, which they'd get if they were to dump their position, just a sudden spike in O/S. There are a few instances in which this may not be the case: - HBC actually plans to dump their position after early exercise is allowed. Whatever. - HBC plans to hold >$700M, close to 10% of their portfolio, in a single low cap stock with no revenue and dubious management. This would dwarf their  - shareholders vote against the proposal. This opens up a pandora box of deals falling apart, and potential default, for Company X. Considering that, in principle, the last could happen and create some turbulence, and looking at a SI of ~20-25%, I would think HBC is employing this strategy for a decent chunk, but not all, of their holdings. Last thing to note: the company has placed another ""catalyst"" (spinoff) one week after the vote, possibly to encourage retail not to offload their shares. This was originally planned for the day after the vote, but has since been postponed. It would help the hedge fund dump the rest of the shares. The question now is:  I bought some puts, was swimming in the green, getting hammered this week. Would you think puts for the spinoff week would work? Puts for this Friday? A month from now? And especially, could the warrant hedging just balloon the O/S without any meaningful price action when exercised? In which case, my puts would be fucked? That's all, thanks for coming to my TED talk tl;dr : the Hudson Bay Capital hedge fund is pulling off some serious fuckery","Hudson Bay Capital: hedge fund pulling off a scam through warrant hedging Hola retardados, I've done some DD on a company trending right now, and I may have figured out a scam/trick an hedge fund is pulling off.

I am mostly a lurker in here but I do post time to time. And recently, I am seeing an influx of bad rumours or advice that seems to be constantly circling around. So, I hope this post might be helpful for those that are kinda new into degen gambling.  Now, here's some common mistakes or rumours or bad advice that's circling around in reddit:    Also, do understand that if someone says hedgies are manipulating the market or things like that, be very sceptical. Are you sure that the person saying that isn't manipulating you? Are you sure that the person saying that is not some fund manager/high net worth individual influencing you to buy some shitty options that they want to sell? Market is influenced/manipulated by everything. Your buying and selling is also a form of manipulation. So understand this, don't fall for ""Hedgies manipulating this stock, if you buy it, you will stick it to the hedgies"" narrative. We are here to make money through short term positions, not to be manipulated by some idealistic rant.       You will find plenty of free materials online that might help you with it. If I were to give you a suggestion about a book, well, ""Option volatility and pricing strategies"" by Sheldon Natenberg may help you with it.   They work like insurance. If you are making 10% or maybe 500%😂 or maybe even more gains a year, it makes sense that you keep your wealth preserved. If someone is warning doom and gloom, you won't have to lose your sleep, because you know when the time comes, you won't be the  💼 holder.   The market will adjust the amount of special dividend that will be given. An options seller will also adjust the price of the options that you are going to buy. So, special dividend is a zero sum game or a rather negative sum game, cause you might create a taxable event which could impact you in the future.   Did you know that up until 2020, long term treasury bonds outperformed S&P 500 (dividend inclusive) for the last 20 years before that?  Although this trend will not be seen any time in the future any longer as bond yields are just too low. That's why we are finally seeing some inflows into stocks instead of outflows from it.   Taxes have destroyed many a gamblers life. They won money in a play. Sold. Then lost all or some of it in another play, in some cases (not all), you might actually owe taxes to the tax authority that you don't even have. This is a very country and individual circumstances specific thing, so I can't really tell you how best to save on taxes unless I know in detail about your circumstances. But for Americans hope this  Also, to add to this, I have seen probably some very dumb comments of people saying things like ""I would owe more taxes if I make more money that's why I am making less money"", don't be that guy.   You should also ask the question why I am writing this? What's my motive? Etc etc.     Remember, for every time you are buying something, someone else is selling those something. Technical analysis can easily show you where buyer and sellers are meeting the most in a condensed format. Understanding it might help you position, enter, exit and most importantly discipline your trades. Does it mean that you should just follow the cup and handle pattern and buy things? No. It is a tool, much like every other tool a gambler can have in their belt.   To understand CPI, you gotta understand the composition of the CPI. Some say, CPI doesn't include housing consumption, which is laughable.  You might see people use a source like shadowstats, which is essentially a completely flawed website. Here's some reading  Yes, CPI has some flaws, but it is not a sham like people try to make it out to be. If inflation is really 10% or 8%, why are commercial banks lending money at such a low rate? Wouldn't they have become bankrupt within this 2 decade?? Better yet, if you really believe that inflation is something percent, put your money where your mouth is and buy up everything you see in Walmart and try to sell that 1 year later also using the low interest environment in your favour.   Hope this helps in clearing out some confusion and have a nice night. And if you have seen or know about some other mistakes or misconceptions people have, please do share!","Some common mistakes we seem to make and how not to repeat them [Long post for newbies] Hello!

But for Americans hope this  Also, to add to this, I have seen probably some very dumb comments of people saying things like ""I would owe more taxes if I make more money that's why I am making less money"", don't be that guy.   You should also ask the question why I am writing this? What's my motive? Etc etc.     Remember, for every time you are buying something, someone else is selling those something. Technical analysis can easily show you where buyer and sellers are meeting the most in a condensed format. Understanding it might help you position, enter, exit and most importantly discipline your trades. Does it mean that you should just follow the cup and handle pattern and buy things? No. It is a tool, much like every other tool a gambler can have in their belt.   To understand CPI, you gotta understand the composition of the CPI. Some say, CPI doesn't include housing consumption, which is laughable.  You might see people use a source like shadowstats, which is essentially a completely flawed website. Here's some reading  Yes, CPI has some flaws, but it is not a sham like people try to make it out to be. If inflation is really 10% or 8%, why are commercial banks lending money at such a low rate? Wouldn't they have become bankrupt within this 2 decade?? Better yet, if you really believe that inflation is something percent, put your money where your mouth is and buy up everything you see in Walmart and try to sell that 1 year later also using the low interest environment in your favour.   Hope this helps in clearing out some confusion and have a nice night. And if you have seen or know about some other mistakes or misconceptions people have, please do share!"

But what I found extremely interesting is the timeline of the news.  -about an hour later FB and it's other platforms experience an outage -around the same time or within the hour news breaks of the FTC complaints and news relating to the gov't trying to force the sale of insta and WhatsApp. So here's my theory. Also to me this sounds all tin foily but also slightly plausible. So I am reaching out to the apes here that are much smarter than me to help fact check or provide any insight. Or just straight up rip this statement apart if it is a crock of shit. Let's begin. So what I'm thinking is would it be far fetched to assume that these the outage is by no means a coincidence but rather planned? With the news of the whistle blower breaking out what if FB intentionally took their servers offline to either: A. Discretely purge records that would confirm whistle blowers statements B. Strong arm the gov't to drop the suit by blaming them on a future date for the outage and having public backlash force the gov't to back off. Why I think this might be plausible is for anyone that's familiar with the game Eve online it's a game that everyones plays on the same server at the same time all over the world regardless of timezone. Therefore the server is always on except for a scheduled downtime that takes the server offline to allow for patches and updates. Now FB is similar in the sence that it's an always on service and probably operates on the same server or set of servers (my guess I don't know). What if in order to get rid of any back end digital paper trails you would need to edit at the architecture/frameworks/coding etc (developers/dev ops chime in here I'm not one so this is purely speculative). Now in order to do so would that require the servers be offline? Alternatively point b. That one is a little more self explanatory people as we know are addicted to social media so it wouldn't be a far stretch to assume that if FB pointed the finger at gov't or another scapegoat and said they forced us to do it people would get into a fit and the outrage would be fierce since there's already alot of distrust of the gov't. Since we know FB loves their data and consciousness experiments (i.e Russian interference in 2016 election, and no this isn't a political debate so keep your idiologies out of it) but since they have a general sense of what the consciousness of a country or demographic would be thinking it wouldn't be hard for them to spin stories that subscribe to people's narratives. Because as we can all agree people are almost most accepting of stories that best fit their own internal narratives. So again this might be a wild conspiracy theory.

2021-10-03 14:24:06.027661,FB,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,18.0,u/bestzec,Leave no Buffett behind. A case for $TEVA Pharmaceuticals coming back with a vengeance,"Was banned from the sub for a few days so posting it a bit late here...  Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Generics… Wait no, the company debt Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits Okay there is a room full of elephants and we’re over the weight limit so let’s let them out one at a time.  As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D’s and Wendy’s all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company’s market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I’m mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug… That’s right it’s TEVA. Viagra is clearly not the only drug I’m on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I’m popping them like tic tacs. And it’s the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crpyto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall. Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I’ll be taking that later when I’m ready to go to sleep. Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need. Oh and if you’re not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn’t weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it’s a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I’m talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I’m paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don’t want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital. Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that’s just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA’s revenues comes from generics.  Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you’re not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA’s revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they’ll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today’s prices (This is also a reason why TEVA’s stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.  There’s been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let’s do some ratios. If a giant company like J&J, that’s worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around ~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion. Are there any elephants left? I’m sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.  What’s valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices. You think i’m going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos’s ex-wife’s bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market). Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it’s more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you’re in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I’m coming back for you. What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I’ve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.  Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark. There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They’ve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating. Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That’s right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they’ve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they’ll keep holding for the price recovery. (Not investing advice)","Leave no Buffett behind. A case for $TEVA Pharmaceuticals coming back with a vengeance Was banned from the sub for a few days so posting it a bit late here...  Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Generics… Wait no, the company debt Wait actually, the opioid lawsuits Okay there is a room full of elephants and we’re over the weight limit so let’s let them out one at a time.  As everyone and their deceased great grandmother likes to point out, margins for generics are thin. However, fast food margins are thin too but we still get Mickey D’s and Wendy’s all the time and they are doing well. Thin margins may be a barrier to navigate around, but it does not prevent success if the overall market and the company’s market share is big enough. Thin margins is a deterrent for new competition and a barrier to entry for new players in the field and an already established behemoth like TEVA will be that much harder to knock down by a newcomer. Furthermore, unlike the fast food consuming population that die early from heart disease and diabetes, preventing the overall fast food industry from growing as they lose their customers (not to mention (yes I’m mentioning it) the growing trend of eating healthily which helps my next point), the growing aging population need more and more affordable drugs (cough generics) to stay alive and performant in the bedroom. Guess which company has a super good, affordable generic viagra drug… That’s right it’s TEVA. Viagra is clearly not the only drug I’m on right now. You guessed it, the other one is adderall, a shit ton of it. I’m popping them like tic tacs. And it’s the TEVA brand of course. As more and more people have a harder time focusing due to navigating the stresses and distractions of life in a pandemic, while competition at every aspect of life (school, work, sex life) is at an all time high, they are diagnosed with ADHD and will need generic adderall that they can afford. Theres also a more recent booming emergence for needing copious amounts of adderall as new, unexperienced traders join the stock and crpyto markets to invest and lose all their money and stare at charts all day, which requires focus for a solid 8-9 hours and can only be done by means of taking a lot of adderall. Did I mention the stress that comes from all these aspects of life? Because TEVA has a Xanax generic to help with that too. I’ll be taking that later when I’m ready to go to sleep. Medically licensed pill prescribers are in on this too. They are raking in the dough. Just ask my psychiatrist. A 5 minute phone conversation on a monthly basis is all I need to replenish all of my prescriptions. No medical checks or anything like that needed either based on my experience. He gets paid over $500 through insurance for these 5 minute interactions. It is easy to find pill pushers to provide the licensed drugs we all know and love, and need. Oh and if you’re not sold on that, then maybe some medical weed will help lower your guard. If you have cancer or some other disease, TEVA can provide you with some generically licensed weed to ease your pain. But bestzec, isn’t weed becoming legalized everywhere? Maybe, but it’s a slow process, and it can still take years for most states and countries to legalize it. Furthermore, even if it was legal everywhere, there are a few important things to consider. It is expensive as shit in states that legalized it. I’m talking $100s of dollars for a few edibles that may last for only a few days. They already make it expensive to begin with and then tax the shit out of it for good measure. Good luck getting enough supply for your daily needs without going bankrupt. Also, many of these dispensaries and the weed that they sell are not FDA approved and is made by unlicensed or inconsistent producers. If I’m paying $100s of dollars that weed better be good and better work. I don’t want some unmixed batch where half my chocolates are only good for cavities and the other half puts me in the hospital. If I can get a pill pusher to prescribe me some regulated weed that I know is consistent, healthy, FDA approved and has insurance covering the cost, then I would much rather do that than going bankrupt and ending up in the hospital. Generics sales are expected to grow over 25% (With everything mentioned earlier, I expect a much higher revenue growth than 25%, but maybe that’s just from my own consumption) over the next 5 years and TEVA is one of only a few big sellers in this field. This translates to increases in billions of revenues for TEVA as a large portion of TEVA’s revenues comes from generics.  Teva has a lot of debt. Like a lot. Even more than I have in the bank. However, looking at their debt chart, they have been reducing it every year since it spiked in 2016. At this rate they can bring it back to the levels of 2015 in about 6 years. Debt is only a problem if the interest is high and you’re not making any money to pay it off, but TEVA’s revenues alone for one year are almost as much as its current debt. Now I know revenues are not profits, but if they reduce some operating expenses (which they have been trimming the fat over the past few years) as well as their generics market keeps growing, they’ll be able to reduce the debt even faster. Lastly, a point about debt in general and why it is not so bad when the interest is low (which it is especially these days). With inflation on the rise and Printer Powell setting his printers on overdrive at an exponential pace for the past few years, printing 40% of the money US has ever had in 2020 alone, covering low interest debt made at historical costs/prices gets easier as value of money is adjusted to today’s prices (This is also a reason why TEVA’s stock price decline for a decade with inflation going haywire is very suspicious). The point is that TEVA is still making a shit ton of money ($17B in 2019) and are managing and reducing their debt.  There’s been headlines making the news about progress around these lawsuits. The bigger companies like J&J are reaching settlements saying they are prepared to pay around $5 B dollars. So let’s do some ratios. If a giant company like J&J, that’s worth $430 B market cap is prepared to only pay $5 B, then Teva, which is completely undervalued and only worth $10 B, should be settling for around ~ $116 M. Even if it was $0.5 B, it would still just be a drop in the bucket of their revenues and they can cover that in 1 quarter alone. Because TEVA also has debt and a low market cap, they can argue to reduce the settlement cost to a reasonable amount. They are not going to charge $TEVA with a $10 Billion dollar fine when J&J which is 43 times bigger is settling for only $5 Billion. Are there any elephants left? I’m sure there are, there always are. Or maybe the ones mentioned are still in the room. So go ahead and bring them up in the comments.  What’s valuable? Getting into undervalued assets; not accurately valued or overvalued assets that are at or around all time high prices. You think i’m going to suggest buying something at all time high price? hell no. Even if it is accurately valued. Not interested. Amazon at 2 Trillion dollars? Apple at 2 Trillion? FB at 1 Trillion? Any other S&P 100 stock? No thanks (I know most of you probably have some of these stocks. I am not saying they should go down in value, just that at Trillions of dollars market cap maybe they are at the very least accurately valued? And less likely to 2x-5x in price in the next few years which would bring some of them to 10 Trillion dollars market cap if they do. Not to mention (again mentioning) their leadership unloading Billions of dollars in shares on current buyers. Not interested in being Bezos’s ex-wife’s bagholder as she dumps her billions, along with Bezos himself, at all time high on the vulnerable retail market). Now looking at the price graph over the past couple decades, it’s more than likely that if you bought and held TEVA then you’re in the red. Even the one true Buffett is in the red based on when he bought his TEVAs. But have no fear Mr. Buffett, I’m coming back for you. What I like about TEVA is that I think it is grossly undervalued based on its current and historical price and compared to other pharma companies valuations. It looks like it has been oversold for some time and this is the accumulation period. Buying it now is pretty much buying it at an all time low as it is clearly at a period of accumulation at the $8-$10 range in the past couple years. Buyers have an opportunity to get shares at a cost that people had 20 years ago, all while inflation has been rampantly ravaging the dollar. I’ve been DCAing for some time to bring my cost basis way down.  Teva has also been revamping their leadership. The current CEO is a family man from Denmark and everyone likes Denmark. There is also a lot of price manipulation happening behind the scenes. The hedge funds have strong control of the stock price so be careful of buying options and holding your call options that expire on Fridays when the price is close to a strike price. They always bring it below so the options expire worthless. They’ve been preventing breakouts upwards for some time during this accumulation period but I doubt they will hold it much longer as more and more people are accumulating. Lastly, looking at the trend of Institutional Ownership and Shareholders that filed forms with the SEC (fintel) over the past 7 years it looks very promising as almost all the shares are now being held strong and there will be a share shortage soon for people trying to get in cheap as TEVA recovers. That’s right, this is not a short squeeze play, at least not yet. There is a lot of institutional owners, many of which are in the red, and no one wants to sell at a loss so most of them probably want to hold till at least $20. If they’ve been holding for this long, and even accumulating more, then they’ll keep holding for the price recovery. (Not investing advice)"

They have already navigated a complex medical system and know AD is terminal with no effective treatment.

More precisely, 39,620 doses of Simufilam were administered from the publicly available data, with no reported serious  In addition, there are 150 patients enrolled in the ""open-label extension trial"" (OLE). They do not have publicly available information; however, it is reasonable to assume the FDA is privy to safety data. The standard protocol requires study sites to report serious adverse events immediately to the FDA. Those OLE patients were administered another 109,500 doses.   Data associated with Simufilam has been remarkably consistent. A 28 day multi-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial with 64 patients measured:  Cassava Sciences stated:  Open-label Extension data tested:  Tallied up, we have 34 different measures over twelve months and twenty-eight days. Now, let us focus on the data which is clinically the most relevant-ADAS cog, and NPI. A valid criticism of the twelve-month OLE data is that it is open-label, susceptible to placebo effect. However, a more comprehensive look into the literature concerning AD, ADAS-cog, and placebo reveals the treatment effect highly probable and Placebo effect unlikely.   A  The disease progression model proposed by Ito et al. shows the expected cognitive decline over time within a 90% prediction interval (shaded area). This suggests a limit to the observed placebo effect as patients do not typically improve from baseline past six months. In a    A follow-up meta-analysis by  Simufilams ADAS-cog data superimposed on Cohorts mentioned above:   The data from Ito et al. and Zhang et al. all conclude that the placebo effect has its limits. A similar pattern can be seen by evaluating the placebo group of Aduhelm. Placebo's effect is less robust and shorter-term. Based on the three sizable cohorts, clear cognitive decline is expected and undeniable as measured by ADAS-cog. Further, it is predictable and measurable. Across the two metal analyses and Aduhelm trial the ADAS-cog declined from 5.2 to 5.8 point decline. So, if a treatment group can show a large enough benefit, such as an improvement from baseline ADAS-cog at twelve months or greater, this is likely beyond the extent of the observed placebo effect in published literature. We will discuss the significant treatment effect noted below. Taking a closer look at the delta between the above cohorts and the OLE ADAS-cog data, overall, the delta is an astonishing 8.2-9.2. In addition, subgroup analysis shows 68% of the patients had an improvement of ADAS-cog of 6.8. This cohort's delta is 11.8 to 12.6. By my estimation, this can not be explained by placebo. Suppose the FDA is looking for a twenty percent decline in the rate of the natural progression of AD, then that is equivalent to ADAS-cog 4.64 - 4.16. and respective deltas of 1.16 -1.04. Effectively Simufilam would have to perform at 14% of its OLE data to get approval. This, plus considering the supportive surrogate data, makes phase three a foregone conclusion, in my opinion.   As mentioned above, behavioral disturbances are the explicit reason families abandon their loved ones in the ER. Caregiver stress is cited in ""Alzheimer's facts and figures"" as having numerous unfavorable outcomes. Worse, physicians are often forced to use antipsychotics for dementia-related psychosis and agitation, which increases the risk of death in the elderly. Restraints (a generous way of referring to tying patients to the bed) are an unfortunate last resort used in the hospital setting to prevent patients from harming themselves and staff. Simufilam use resulted in markedly fewer behavior disturbances, and this data continues to improve with time. Fast-tracking a medication after a single-arm study would not be an unprecedented action by the FDA. As Ke Liu, MD, PhD cites  As is known, the cognitive data was collected over sixteen clinical sites across the US and Canada by independent Physician PI's and associated staff (unaffiliated with Cassava Sciences). The chain of custody was made transparent and verified by independent biostatisticians. AD claims the lives of 13 patients every hour, and if the FDA allows phase three trials to continue for two years, then we risk the deaths of over 240,000 patients. As functional status is an excellent predictor of morbidity and mortality. I believe by preserving cognitive function, Simufilam will also preserve functional status (as the two are highly correlated). It may take years to see a mortality benefit, but waiting years in the setting of limited risk is unacceptable.

Trying again with discussion. Let me know if there is another flair (or another subreddit) that would be more appropriate.] I do not have a position because I do not know all the ins and outs on insider trading rules. So I am posting it here to make it not insider information. This is all thirdhand information from somebody that doesn't have a full view of the company. He probably doesn't know what he's talking about. That would mean I definitely don't know what I am talking about. You shouldn't trade on any of the following information. That would be silly. The CEO and People & Culture (HR) bigwigs are going around middle management and pushing hard on vaccine status attestation. They will almost certainly be going hard on vaccines themselves soon. Things have come to a head and the bigwigs have put those unwilling to attest to vaccination status on leave-without-pay. It probably only affected a handful of the most artistic programmers. They have done this without consulting the project managers. The affected project managers are going to have a hard time getting their projects done with some of their most artistic employees pulled from the team suddenly. My understanding is there was no planning for this. Upper management seems to assume programmers are a commodity. I suspect they are not. I am assuming antivaxxers skew artistic in the programming world. Just based on past experience, good programmers are not in-the-box-thinkers, they tend to think they are smarter than everybody else about everything, and are the most likely not to respond well to ""do this because I said so"" stuff. Viasat hasn't gotten to the get-vaxxed-or-get-out point. But it seems like that is likely going to be coming soon. And when it does, they will be sidelining many more of their most artistic programmers. I know many think the company is going to eat it when Starlink comes out. I don't know about that.

I suspect Viasat is planning on locking out or repurposing other slightly-less-artistic-but-still-pretty-artistic programmers for not being vaxxed. And Viasat thinks this won't be such a big deal because they plan on rearranging the workforce because C-suite managers think that's no big deal with programming projects. I think that means Viasat is prolly going to eat some shit you weren't expecting. Because what Viasat does is hard and programmers are not commodities. And Viasat is pulling off something like a 1941 Red Army Purge right before the Starlink competition kicks off and the Viasat-3 launch. They probably aren't going to zero or anything.

Trying again with discussion. Let me know if there is another flair (or another subreddit) that would be more appropriate.] I do not have a position because I do not know all the ins and outs on insider trading rules. So I am posting it here to make it not insider information. This is all thirdhand information from somebody that doesn't have a full view of the company. He probably doesn't know what he's talking about. That would mean I definitely don't know what I am talking about. You shouldn't trade on any of the following information. That would be silly. The CEO and People & Culture (HR) bigwigs are going around middle management and pushing hard on vaccine status attestation. They will almost certainly be going hard on vaccines themselves soon. Things have come to a head and the bigwigs have put those unwilling to attest to vaccination status on leave-without-pay. It probably only affected a handful of the most artistic programmers. They have done this without consulting the project managers. The affected project managers are going to have a hard time getting their projects done with some of their most artistic employees pulled from the team suddenly. My understanding is there was no planning for this. Upper management seems to assume programmers are a commodity. I suspect they are not. I am assuming antivaxxers skew artistic in the programming world.

Around 2:45 pm yesterday, AR/VR/Haptic stocks moved considerably, and I think this was because of an event in Facebook yesterday (Facebook Connect 2021) which basically was talking all about their plans for AR/VR and the Metaverse. Now, out of all the the few tickers that has quite an exposure to this niche sector, i chose HIMX due to the fact that this company is not only way too undervalued, but also is very profitable. With a PE ratio of only 8.5 and a nice earnings per share of 1.26, this is the real deal. Lets view the charts:     We are consolidating coming from a short downtrend and is currently trading on a range. Im seeing a really nice breakout around 10.8 to 11, and I think, if this sector will move due to Mark Zuckerberg getting memed almost everywhere because of Meta, not to mention there are already chatter about Facebook's Project Cambria and Project Nazare, I dont see why this sector will not move today or the next few days. For you guys out there that doesnt know what Himax does, it is a fabless semiconductor company that focuses on providing display imaging processing technologies components, such as AR/VR hardware. We all know about the chip shortage yada yada yada, and that semiconductors have been raising their prices yada yada yada, those are all good dont get me wrong, but I like the idea more that this could breakout soon and run with them AR/VR stocks. Anyway, posted below are their customers:   Wouldnt it be nice if those two things encircled in yellow are the talked about Apple glasses and the all new Occulus Quest from Facebook? I would probably give away my wife and get me a new one if that becomes a reality!   There are really nice DDs on this ticker here in WSB, you can always search for the ticker in the search bar and you guys will find a lot of info.  I got 7,000 shares initially and will add on breakout. This is not financial advise and I am not a financial adviser. I am someone needing money so I can afford to have another wife.

Along with the main runners from last week we have new soldiers joining the generals in the deSPAC wars. These tickers have been running even with the broader market tanking, wrecking the accounts of SPY bulls (including me REEEEE). While these plays are still ongoing, the IV has spiked enough in almost all these cases making the fabled multibaggers harder to come by. I was searching for something that hasn't taken off yet and saw that every single  What is Cazoo? Let me give a very quick overview of CZOO and why it could be a good long term hold at these levels (unlike many deSPACs running currently). All you deSPAC degens can safely skip this section.  CEO Alex Chesterman OBE, looks like a guy who knows what he is doing Cazoo is a European online used car-seller. Similar to Carvana in the US.  Unlike Carvana and competitors, they also provide a subscription service for the same as well. Cazoo is mainly based in the UK and expanded to France and Germany. They are expanding aggressively across Europe and would also use the proceeds from the SPAC deal for the same. When the deal was struck many investors did not like it as they were expecting something sexy like an EV company as those was all the rage back then (we know now how those turned out). Especially since the SPAC was founded by billionaire investor Dan Och and had a stellar leadership. There were also many concerns regarding the valuation as the deal valued Cazoo at $7B. People failed to realize how transformative the pandemic has been to Cazoo's business.  Now that they have a $1B dollar warchest from the SPAC deal (trust + PIPE), they can aggressively go about crushing the competition taking a leaf out of Amazon's playbook. This cash they got from the deal is a moat that insulates them from competition as they rapidly expand and acquire new customers. Looking back, this seems to be one of the few SPAC deals that have aged well. Since the deal was made, CVNA soared as much as 53% and is now 30% higher. This is in stark contrast to many SPAC deals, where the comps have gone down significantly (looking at you HIPO)  Cazoo is a recent deSPAC and it usually takes a while before analysts start coverage. However, Citigroup has already initiated coverage with a buy rating and a  The technical setup: CZOO completed the merger on Aug 27 and had 72.32% of the trust redeemed according to the   Relevant section fom the 8-K regarding redemptions The PIPE holders have ~80M shares which are under lockup currently. CZOO hasn't filed the S-1 yet so these shares won't hit the markets anytime soon. Once the S-1 is filed, it is followed by the 424B and then EFFECT following which the shares can sold. Other deSPAC plays like AGIL, VLTA, XOS are on borrowed time as they have already filed S-1s. On average it takes about 21 days post S-1 till PIPE shares become registered. So these can go on till then. I couldn't find active discussions on CZOO in trading/investment subreddits so this seems undiscovered.   The last exchange reported SI was 2.72M which is 12% of the float. This is based on the Aug 31st settlement date which falls after the merger and hence includes any change in SI post merger. Many people are unaware of this, but shorts are usually closed out at NAV incase of high redemption deSPACs so unless you have post merger exchange reported SI, the various SI tracking services get it wrong. Currently Ortex does not estimate the SI but reports the shares on loan at 5.16M. All  shares loaned out need not be shorted so the max SI according to Ortex would be 23% of the float. In addition to this, the CTB has creeped up to 19% and the utilization is at 88.5% which means there is not a lot of ammo left to short this down. The days to cover is estimated to be 10.32 based on current volume.  The PA so far reminds me of how a deSPAC moves before it pops big. The fade on low volume after merger followed by the float up on low volume.  CZOO This type of indecisive movement on low volume can found across multiple high redemption deSPACs. Let us consider the example of SPIR, one of the new favorites. It had been trading in the low volume zombie zone since the merger completion and once volume came in, BAM!!  SPIR. Sorry I had to make a yOu aRe hErE reference.    I noticed a curious spike in bullish call volume last week and early this week, which alerted me to the play. Here is the kicker,  Here is a general comment on these plays since I know many of you got burned buying OTM FDs at nosebleed IV levels last week. Stop buying 500% IV OTM FDs tards! It may actually hurt the chances of a Gamma squeeze. Once MMs collect those juicy premiums from those way OTM calls, they would be able to offset some of the losses from the calls they wrote earlier and hence maybe to hedge less aggressively. The ATM IV for Oct expiry for CZOO sits at ~97%.

These tickers have been running even with the broader market tanking, wrecking the accounts of SPY bulls (including me REEEEE). While these plays are still ongoing, the IV has spiked enough in almost all these cases making the fabled multibaggers harder to come by. I was searching for something that hasn't taken off yet and saw that every single  What is Cazoo? Let me give a very quick overview of CZOO and why it could be a good long term hold at these levels (unlike many deSPACs running currently). All you deSPAC degens can safely skip this section.  CEO Alex Chesterman OBE, looks like a guy who knows what he is doing Cazoo is a European online used car-seller. Similar to Carvana in the US.  Unlike Carvana and competitors, they also provide a subscription service for the same as well. Cazoo is mainly based in the UK and expanded to France and Germany. They are expanding aggressively across Europe and would also use the proceeds from the SPAC deal for the same. When the deal was struck many investors did not like it as they were expecting something sexy like an EV company as those was all the rage back then (we know now how those turned out). Especially since the SPAC was founded by billionaire investor Dan Och and had a stellar leadership. There were also many concerns regarding the valuation as the deal valued Cazoo at $7B. People failed to realize how transformative the pandemic has been to Cazoo's business.  Now that they have a $1B dollar warchest from the SPAC deal (trust + PIPE), they can aggressively go about crushing the competition taking a leaf out of Amazon's playbook. This cash they got from the deal is a moat that insulates them from competition as they rapidly expand and acquire new customers. Looking back, this seems to be one of the few SPAC deals that have aged well. Since the deal was made, CVNA soared as much as 53% and is now 30% higher. This is in stark contrast to many SPAC deals, where the comps have gone down significantly (looking at you HIPO)  Cazoo is a recent deSPAC and it usually takes a while before analysts start coverage. However, Citigroup has already initiated coverage with a buy rating and a  The technical setup: CZOO completed the merger on Aug 27 and had 72.32% of the trust redeemed according to the   Relevant section fom the 8-K regarding redemptions The PIPE holders have ~80M shares which are under lockup currently. CZOO hasn't filed the S-1 yet so these shares won't hit the markets anytime soon. Once the S-1 is filed, it is followed by the 424B and then EFFECT following which the shares can sold. Other deSPAC plays like AGIL, VLTA, XOS are on borrowed time as they have already filed S-1s. On average it takes about 21 days post S-1 till PIPE shares become registered. So these can go on till then. I couldn't find active discussions on CZOO in trading/investment subreddits so this seems undiscovered.   The last exchange reported SI was 2.72M which is 12% of the float. This is based on the Aug 31st settlement date which falls after the merger and hence includes any change in SI post merger. Many people are unaware of this, but shorts are usually closed out at NAV incase of high redemption deSPACs so unless you have post merger exchange reported SI, the various SI tracking services get it wrong. Currently Ortex does not estimate the SI but reports the shares on loan at 5.16M. All  shares loaned out need not be shorted so the max SI according to Ortex would be 23% of the float. In addition to this, the CTB has creeped up to 19% and the utilization is at 88.5% which means there is not a lot of ammo left to short this down. The days to cover is estimated to be 10.32 based on current volume.  The PA so far reminds me of how a deSPAC moves before it pops big. The fade on low volume after merger followed by the float up on low volume.  CZOO This type of indecisive movement on low volume can found across multiple high redemption deSPACs. Let us consider the example of SPIR, one of the new favorites. It had been trading in the low volume zombie zone since the merger completion and once volume came in, BAM!!  SPIR. Sorry I had to make a yOu aRe hErE reference.    I noticed a curious spike in bullish call volume last week and early this week, which alerted me to the play. Here is the kicker,  Here is a general comment on these plays since I know many of you got burned buying OTM FDs at nosebleed IV levels last week. Stop buying 500% IV OTM FDs tards! It may actually hurt the chances of a Gamma squeeze. Once MMs collect those juicy premiums from those way OTM calls, they would be able to offset some of the losses from the calls they wrote earlier and hence maybe to hedge less aggressively. The ATM IV for Oct expiry for CZOO sits at ~97%.

Here are the results!,"There is an old saying on Wall Street.  If you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up! It’s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO’s, VP’s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon? In this week’s analysis let’s put this to the test.      The data for this analysis was taken from  it’s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 [1]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.  The financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.      For all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months & 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&P500 over the same time period. My hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.      Surprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year. I have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.  But the number of trades that made positive returns shows a different story. When compared to trading SPY, a lesser number of trades would have generated profits in the case of following insider purchases. The key here is that while the chances of your trading making a profit is lower, if it does end up making a profit, you would generally have had a better return than the market.     There are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.      Usually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it’s time to get out of that market. This analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information [4]. You may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style.

Is this GFC 2.0, featuring our new friend the Orphan SPV?","Ok, so I have done a little research on this topic, and what the fallout from Evergrande could look like. I was bouncing around on twitter and I saw Michael Burry was getting all worked up about Evergrande. Now, I have no background in finance other than a personal interest in learning, but from my limited understanding I could not see anything at first in the information he linked and from other sources to that would point to a widespread collapse like he was claiming. I mean, Evergrande is big, but they hold $300+ billion in assets. Even if they are forced to restructure the losses could not be that bad globally right?  They only have about $18 Billion in foreign bonds outstanding on the international market, how could that lead to a global crash? Sure, the slowdown in China overall as a result will cause pain to some countries, like Australia, but not a global crash right? So I did a little more digging, and one of the things the data Burry linked to very specifically in his tweet said to look at the dates, in relation to the bonds starting to devalue in May this year. Well, thanks to the power of google, I learn that in May China started to crack down on 'shadow lending' or 'off the books lending' right when their public bonds started to turn to dog poo. And here we go, the rabbit hole. What the hell is shadow lending? Well, it all starts with this little policy China introduced in August last year to slow down the growth of their insane property markets. It is called the three line policy. I won't bore you with the details, google exists, go use it if you want. The TL;DR is if developers in China cross these lines in how much debt they have compared to assets, the amount of new debt they can take on is restricted. You cross all three, you turn red and can no longer grow the amount of debt you have. At least not on the books anyway... Evergrande crossed that line last year, it has not been allowed to 'legally' grow the amount of debt it has since then. Bring in the shadow banking system! The orphan special purpose vehicle. From my understanding, this system works much like this. Evergrande spins up what is called an orphan special purpose vehicle, this SPV, if it is based offshore, does not need to follow the laws in place in regards to the three red lines. Evergrande can then use the funds in that SPV like they would a loan, but without having to declare it on their books at all, they don't technically own the debt, some other fake business in say, the Caymans does in return for interest that Evergrande just happens to pay (or not). So, what does this mean?! Well... this is what I think Burry and others have been attempting to warn us about. What we know about the extent of Foreign debt in China is only the tip of the iceberg. Evergrande and other developers in China may hold much higher international liabilities than anyone is aware of, these SPV's are off the books, unrelated to Evergrande in any way other than being a source of liquidity for them to use. Who paid in to these SPV's? What is the total value of debt outstanding? If they get restructured will they repay these SPV's? No one knows... Well, some people do, but they are not talking. Ever since they have been restricted from issuing new bonds, or taking out loans, they have had to have been getting cash from somewhere and their asset sales are simply not enough to cover their costs to continue to grow, especially at the discounted prices recently. I know this is a wall of text but I think this might be very important and could be why some of the largest international investment funds have been in talks with Evergrande and the CCP. This problem could be much larger than anyone knows. Many international entities may have much more exposure to Evergrande and other aspects of the Chinese real estate market than anyone understands and when they get restructured those SPV investors will certainly be left holding the bag. Is this literally GFC 2.0, did those hedge funds and investment firms get greedy again and try to take a larger slice of the massive $50 Trillion dollar Chinese real estate market with SPVs? Is that what has Burry and others all worked up? Am I being incredibly 'Smooth brain' and missing something key here?

Bulls and Bears invited!,"I was asked by my pops when the correction was going to end, and it made me think that it was a good topic to have a discussion on with my favorite retards. Here is my response “Well, seeing as how everyone is over leveraged including hedge funds, it could pull back 10%. Right now it's at 5, and everyone swore it wouldn't get to 5 lol. The 50 EMA, which is the uptrending channel it's been on for the past year and a half, convincingly broke the past two trading sessions. It is now focused on the 100EMA, if it breaks that, youre looking at a fall to about 390/395 for the SPY, and 3800 for the SPX. (Spitballing here for you gay technical gurus) To be honest though, I'm not buying that it will be a crash or a major correction past 7%. I believe it falls tomorrow and Wednesday, which allows me to make profit lol, and then soars Friday. There is no way the federal reserve 1) stops buying bonds at the rate they are doing, or 2) hike interest rates while delta variant is growing in the US. Although the economy is showing good growth, and inflation is running rampid (not transitory like  they try to say), the fed will continue to print infinite money therefore ruining the economy and setting up another great financial crisis event. The crash will severely destruct the country.  I'm hoping for a 10% correction, which is healthy for the economy and also for my bank account, I've already made my profit thus far, but if it doesn't continue correction and reverses to all time highs, we are going to enter a year long recession. There just isn't anymore money to throw at the economy without it coming back. And technically, the S&P/Nasdaq are tech heavy and controlled by FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, google), if there is a sector rotation there isn't one single sector that can hold a candle to them. The economy will falter.” I’m not the smartest in the world on any of these subjects. I suspect neither of you guys are either. Jokes are welcomed. And I’m also willing to learn on shit I was probably wrong on in here. CAN YOUUUU DIGGGG ITTTTT?! LET THE GAMES BEGIN!

Seriously, you guys have been barreling through the gates of high SPAC redemption this last month. IRNT? Did it. TMC? Got it. OPAD? Get it. So what else is on the menu…? How about some easy peasy S. P. I. R. squeezy. There’s a million SPACs to squeeze, so… why this one? Let’s start here, LIQUIDITY. The average daily volume over the last 5 days is only 2.3mm (115%) for SPIR… whereas IRNT is 28.3mm (2,200% float), TMC 18.7mm (690% float), and OPAD 29.4mm (860% float). I mean… the volume was only 0.67mm on Friday before the pump. Um… say liquidity squeeze anyone? SPIR is so illiquid that DFV could squeeze this as a side hustle. Seriously, the capital required needs no hedgie (although we are accepting applications).  Spire Global (SPIR) owns a ton of satellites that provide data and analytics for maritime, aviation, and weather purposes. That have several levels of subscriptions to provide. Their subscriptions are growing but… they lose money. For this play, we are all about the technicals so I won’t spend time on fundamentals. Let’s talk tech.  As noted above, this thing is so illiquid that you might wanna turn the bottle upside down. Plenty of other tickers have low float but only this one is a ghost town. The total Class A shares outstanding is 134mm, most is locked up with insiders, institutions, and PIPE investors. The 23mm initial shares had 21mm redeemed (91%), leaving only 1.98mm shares for an effective initial float. For comparison, IRNT is 1.3mm, TMC 2.7mm, and OPAD 3.4mm.   (Note those 5.75mm converted from Class B are allocated to the sponsor and are subject to a specific lock up, leaving only 1.98mm for float) (Note those 5.75mm converted from Class B are allocated to the sponsor and are subject to a specific lock up, leaving only 1.98mm for float) According to the 8-K, the company must file for PIPE registration (S-1) within 45 days of the closing of the merger. The PIPE will account for an additional 24.5MM so… let’s not over stay our welcome. The merger closed 8/16/21 so the deadline to submit the S-1 is by (or before) 9/30/21. As of Friday (9/17), no S-1 has been filed. The timeline for EFFECT filing is variable but is typically 1-2 weeks after the S-1 is filed. Therefore, the potential timeline for PIPE is anywhere from 9/27 to 10/15. Once the PIPE is fully registered, all bets are off. The other investors are subject to a lock up for at least 60 days from closing (8/16/21). So for at least the next week, we stay squeezy.  Shorts have been priming this over the last several weeks. SI now amounts to an estimated 1.05mm shares or 53% SI of the current available float of 1.98mm. There are no shares to borrow from IBKR or Fidelity and I’d be willing to bet that’s the same for other brokerages. The average estimated short cost basis is $10.48. As of close Friday (9/17), shorts are at an estimated 30% average loss and we’re just getting started.   The utilization has been at 100% and the cost of borrow is currently at 78% (ortex), 65% (IBKR), and 25% (Fidelity). the SI exceeds on loan by 78% which may indicate naked shorting. After all, if MMs have hedged the float but you degenerates keep buying, they gotta sell the fake shares.  The option chain has been getting jacked over the last month. It’s pretty insane due to the low float. Based on the OI reporting for 9/17 options on Friday, 0.8mm shares are tied to ITM contracts (net delta between ITM calls and puts). We’re talking 40% of the float if exercised. In total, the call OI for 9/17 expiration was 15,134 but… the remaining call OI for all other expirations is still 37,532 (48% which is tied to 10/15). The chain could get pumped further if call buying post-quad witching builds steam on Monday. After all, this is just getting started. Option surface plots across all expirations:    Call OI is tearing upwards while we see with our microscope that the puts are pretty pathetic. MMs are delta hedged to the tits but what about that sexy gamma ramp? How is hedging going to change as price rockets (per OI; per BSM):  (Note the x-axis for this graph is NOT strike, it is the actual stock price as it moves) The price has been trading in the $7.5 - $12.5 range since deSPAC, requiring theoretical hedging anywhere from 0 - 150% of float. But… the hedging becomes insane above $12.5. On Friday, we saw the effect. The price broke up towards $15 before settling at close at $13.71. This price action required 150-200% float delta hedge… wow. If this break up above $20, the hedging blows above 250%. This is no joke and if the option chain continues to build, the gamma ramp will only get more psychotic.  There were bullish signals this last Thursday (9/16) and Friday (9/17). Thursday, we saw a bearish reversal candle. Based on other squeezes, this can be a signal of a bear trap before a breakout, just like we’ve seen with so many other friends:   Remember when everyone bailed on IRNT at like $25? Um… bear trap guys. Stage was set on Thursday for SPIR just like it was for IRNT. On Friday, most SPACs were bleeding in sympathy with the fall of IRNT. However, midday, SPIR broke out from $10.70 up to $14.79. The price consolidated towards lower volume, curled up, then broke out again to finish the day at $13.71. Watching price action and the tape, there are signals a large player (or players) may by pushing. Since the ticker is so illiquid, it only takes a small volume of options activity to move.  This SPAC opportunity is unique due to liquidity issues. In addition, the short interest is maxed and the gamma ramp is stacked. With a little push (like Friday), this thing rockets.

I’m a former bull who transitioned into a permabear. Until last week, I believed the downside to SPY and the wider economy were greater than the upside.  So what changed?  Background  I caught wind of Evergrande before the wider public began losing its mind. I also did research on the Chinese Shadow Banking system (google it) in 2016-2017. Basically, China’s economy is one giant dumpster fire propped up by government intervention (kind of sounds like the US now huh?).  Every dataset out of China is steaming garbage. The numbers are all made up to meet made up regulatory thresholds. The government hides default risk through constant intervention. Companies that seem strong are always propped up by stimulus behind the scenes. So Evergrande is really not much of a surprise.  Capital Controls  China has insane capital controls. As a result, there is little true US investment in China. Goldman Sachs and other big banks circumvent this somewhat by creating Chinese subsidiaries that are partially state-owned. Basically, the government ends up owning whatever US-based investment firm/enterprise you build in China. These capital controls essentially limited risk that US firms take on. Unless banks did some truly retarded shit (which is possible), then the contagion should be limited to their holdings (which appear to be limited).  Real Estate  As everyone knows, Chinese nationals love real estate. Evergrande blowing up with clearly force some wider sell offs as institutions try to deleverage. That’s expected.  REVERSE REPO  Now here’s the beauty of what JPOW did. The reverse repo facility acts as a sponge. I won’t go into details, but basically, it sucks up excess liquidity. The facility hit 1.2 TRILLION recently, meaning that instituions have so few asset buying opportunities that they rather park the cash at the Fed. This sponge will release liquidity when needed. If Evergrande truly isn’t bailed out, and there are liquidity ramifications in the US, it is my belief that this excess liquidity can more than cover any sort of shortfalls.  Furthermore, I was a permabear because I saw tapering on the horizon. This will just prolong our money printing.  TLDR: Evergrande might blow up, but we have enough liquidity to cover the partial fallout. BUY THE DIP!!!

2021-10-03 14:30:32.893763,GOOGL,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,31.0,u/Flipper-man,[DD] Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)," The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. ​​           August 19, 2021 [Source](  September 16, 2021 [Source](   Market Cap (MKT Cap)  *Mkt Cap has increased 173.9% in five years EPS (Dilution)  *EPS has increased 72.8% in five years  Total Revenue (TR)  *TR has increased 58.7% in five years Price to Sales Ratio (PS)  *PS has increased 537.04% in five years Net Margin  *Net Margin has increased 6.7% in five years Price to Earnings Ratio (PE)  *PE has increased 102.7% in five years Price to Book Ratio (PB)    Total Liabilities  *Total liabilities has increased 134.4% in five years Long Term Debt  *Long term debt has increased 403.6% in five years Debt to Equity Ratio (DE)  *DE ratio has increased 266.7% in five years                 February 10, 2021 [Source]  May 13, 2021 [Source](         [Source]( ​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:     Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.  The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates.

","[DD] Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM)  The recent chip shortage has shown that the U.S can't keep up with semiconductor demand. Joe Biden has laid out a $50B subsidy plan for research and development in the semiconductor industry. In the CEO Summit on Semiconductor Supply Chain Resilience, Biden stated that this was a “once in a generation” investment for the future. Semiconductor chips are as essential to our everyday lives as water. ​​           August 19, 2021 [Source](  September 16, 2021 [Source](   Market Cap (MKT Cap)  *Mkt Cap has increased 173.9% in five years EPS (Dilution)  *EPS has increased 72.8% in five years  Total Revenue (TR)  *TR has increased 58.7% in five years Price to Sales Ratio (PS)  *PS has increased 537.04% in five years Net Margin  *Net Margin has increased 6.7% in five years Price to Earnings Ratio (PE)  *PE has increased 102.7% in five years Price to Book Ratio (PB)    Total Liabilities  *Total liabilities has increased 134.4% in five years Long Term Debt  *Long term debt has increased 403.6% in five years Debt to Equity Ratio (DE)  *DE ratio has increased 266.7% in five years                 February 10, 2021 [Source]  May 13, 2021 [Source](         [Source]( ​​4 ways to reduce water consumption in semiconductor manufacturing:     Looking at the 6-month chart for TSM, strong resistance and support lines indicate a resistance around the $125 mark and solid support around the $108 mark. A buying opportunity may come up if we see TSM dip down near its support range. Bullish breakthrough at $125 and bearish breakthrough at $108.  The biggest issue the semiconductor industry faces today is heating. Semiconductor fabs use the water equivalent of 12 golf courses. The solution to this problem is dry etching which uses gaseous chemicals to make patterns on substrates.

If this picture is too blurry, the support/resistances are $19.24, $27.11, $33.29, $37.63, $41.97, $47.34, and $56.06. Started the line with the lowest point before September 14th. These are levels to check throughout the week and especially Monday and Tuesday. We're looking to support at $33.39.

I think there's a lot that can come out of this stock, but also if the interest isn't there then probably not.

Here are the results.," A community that defines itself like this is not a confidence-inspiring place to get stock picks to YOLO your next paycheck into. I think, being the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins should make you seriously question the incentive of folks who are making the recommendations! Whether it’s for the insane YOLOs posted every day, or breaking Robinghood with infinite leverage plays, or the legendary short-squeeze involving GME, here is where the action goes down! But what I am interested in is to see if       Reddit’s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20. The summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from      Ahh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit. So what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day [2]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock. Considering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next a. One Week b. One Month c. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today) The benchmark for comparison is SPY[3]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.     Before we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of       We would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments [4] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now) But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately [5]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays). So, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?    Would you look at that!  But keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.    GME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money [6]. Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.  Unsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week.    For every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag. But what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the   Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks [7].     There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of      Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with  I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too  Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the  Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!     [1] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week. [2] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers. [3] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile. [4] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance. [5] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as  [6] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns are  [7] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally.

What if you only wanted to invest in the   Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks [7].     There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of      Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with  I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag. But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too  Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the  Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!     [1] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week. [2] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers. [3] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile. [4] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance. [5] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as  [6] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns are  [7] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember,  "

There has been a noticeable amount of INTC posts but non of these delve into their technical shortfalls compared to their competitors AMD NVDA TSM ARM etc I wrote this many years ago  and the gap in technology is even bigger in AMD's favor.  Since 2016 I've been super bullish on AMD at $1.80, cloud computing stocks MSFT AMZN, energy stocks like TSLA etc. If you've ever been in a datacenter it consumes a ton of energy and why I think the future of computing is AMD NVDA TSM ARM MSFT AMZN  and energy efficiency stocks. INTC lacks this and is falling way behind in tech and design, still far behind and I literally called it years ago almost on the dot. Other users have noticed this too  My post pointing out that since 2016 AMD NVDA TSM have been superior in design efficiency and stock price was promptly deleted on that sub.  I reminded them that since 2016 AMD price has increased close to 6800%, NVDA 3400%, TSM 500%, cloud computing has taken off and MSFT is up 600% AMZN 500%. Intel is gone up maybe 30% in the biggest stock run and semiconductor/cloud computing run in 5-6 years.  Abysmal compared to every semi stock. So be weary of INTC suggestions.

Well, it’s now the largest company in the world. The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant. Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to  And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult! Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE. Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical. I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC. AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.😂 INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction. But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals. It’s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think). Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely. Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything? If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. (I am not saying you shouldn’t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult) As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely. With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter. TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults. Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.","The power of cult: Why I think DWAC is primed to move higher and so will other similar cult stocks Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?

2021-10-18 14:41:13.643102,NFLX,Reddit/r/wallstreetbets,18.0,u/Lost-Guarantee229,Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate,"There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of “Squid Games”. Squid Games has quickly become an international sensation after reaching 111M+ global viewers in more than 200 different countries. Squid games has brought a lot of hype to Netflix (and their original content) and has set the stage for an interesting Q3 2021 earnings report for their stock investors. Today, I am here to predict how Netflix’s Q3 earnings report will go, and a large part of this will be focusing on the growth of their platform in the past quarter due to their hit show “Squid Games”. At the end of this analysis, you will find a   Firstly, as we know, Squid Games had reached over 111M global users in over 200 countries in the past month alone. This in and of itself is impressive, however factoring in their low production cost of $21.4M makes it exponentially more impressive. Squid Games was able to keep these costs low due to filming in South Korea (Internationally) which allows for actors to work longer hours and can bring the cost of production down. Top executives have predicted that the cost to shoot domestically (in Hollywood) would have been 5-10x more than Netflix’s cost of production. This series in particular has opened the floodgates for streaming services to shoot internationally, as many of them are now starting to express interest in it. Squid Games was a huge money maker for Netflix and has been estimated to be worth in the ballpark of $900M, which represents a return on their investment (production) of over 4,100%. Considering Netflix’s revenues last quarter were $7.3B, Squid Games is likely to represent a large percentage of their revenues in Q3, and since their margins are so impressive, it is likely that we see Squid Games have a role to play in Netflix having better margins on their upcoming earnings.  The most important factor that I derived from Netflix’s Q2 2021 financial report is the fact that their weighted average subscription price across all of their regions is $12.26. This will be very important in determining the revenues in Q3 2021. Furthermore, Netflix’s revenues in Q2 2021 were $7.34B, and their cost of revenues was $4.02B (54.73% of revenues).   I am basing Netflix’s revenues off of their previous revenues, plus the new revenues that are brought in by additional subscribers in this quarter. Firstly, to get the new subscriber figures I decided to take Netflix’s estimate of 3.5M in this quarter for the first 3 months, due to squid games not being added. This resulted in 900k new subscribers per month for the first 3 months, which adds up to 2.7M new subscribers in June, July, and August. Lastly, we needed the new subscribers for the month of September. This was more difficult to calculate as they released Squid Games this month which drove in far more traffic than usual. In order to get a proxy for how many new subscribers a “hit” like Squid Games can bring in, I used the data from Netflix’s 2nd biggest show “Bridgerton.” Like Squid Games, Bridgerton was released 1 month prior to their earnings report, and helped Netflix to beat their new subscriber estimates by 41%. However, since squid games is 50% more popular than Bridgerton was in their first month, I think it is reasonable to estimate that Squid Games can help Netflix beat their Q3 2021 new subscriber estimates by 61.5%. Increasing Netflix’s Q3 subscriber figures yield 5.65M new subscribers over the whole quarter. This means that in September, Netflix likely brought in 2.95M new subscribers mostly off of the success of Squid Games. Overall, if Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers June, their revenue generated for the quarter would be $44.32M (900000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in July, their revenues generated for the quarter would be $33.1M (900,000*$12.26*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in August, their revenues for the quarter would be $22.07M (900,000*$12.26*2 months). Lastly, if Netflix brought in 2.95M subscribers in September as a result of Squid Games, their quarterly revenues would be $36.16M. In total, it is reasonable to assume Netflix increased their revenues by $136.22M, bringing their Q3 revenues to $7.48B. However, Netflix has been reported to have increased their prices by $1 in many regions. To be conservative, we can assume a $0.50 increase across all regions, which would result in a 4% increase on average prices. This would then cause Netflix’s quarterly revenues to be 4% higher, totalling $7.78B. This would represent earnings beat of 0.28B (or 3.7%).  As previously mentioned, Squid Games is very likely to have increased Netflix’s margins. As a result of this we can conservatively estimate that Netflix’s cost of revenues is 54% of their revenues (as opposed to 54.73% in Q2 2021). By doing this their cost of revenues should be $4.2B  Assuming that Netflix’s other costs are the same % of revenues as they were in the previous quarter, we can estimate all of these other expenses to total $1.56B.  If these assumptions are correct, then Netflix’s operating income for Q3 2021 should be $2.01B.  Assuming Netflix’s Net Income to Operating Income ratio is the same (over the past 6 months), we can estimate that Netflix’s Q3 Net Income figure to be $1.25B.  Since Netflix has 442.6M shares outstanding, their diluted EPS should be $2.74. This would represent a 7% EPS  I think that Netflix is going to narrowly beat earnings, which in theory should be good for the stock. However, since Squid Games was released, the stock has been up 6-7%. As a result, I think that NFLX will not have a big reaction from their earnings. I think that they might open the next trading day (October 20th) up between 0-1% and close the day between -0.5% and +0.5%. If I am correct, then the best way that I could think to play this via iron condors. I think that a 600/615/635/650 iron condor would be suitable given ","Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of “Squid Games”. Squid Games has quickly become an international sensation after reaching 111M+ global viewers in more than 200 different countries. Squid games has brought a lot of hype to Netflix (and their original content) and has set the stage for an interesting Q3 2021 earnings report for their stock investors. Today, I am here to predict how Netflix’s Q3 earnings report will go, and a large part of this will be focusing on the growth of their platform in the past quarter due to their hit show “Squid Games”. At the end of this analysis, you will find a   Firstly, as we know, Squid Games had reached over 111M global users in over 200 countries in the past month alone. This in and of itself is impressive, however factoring in their low production cost of $21.4M makes it exponentially more impressive. Squid Games was able to keep these costs low due to filming in South Korea (Internationally) which allows for actors to work longer hours and can bring the cost of production down. Top executives have predicted that the cost to shoot domestically (in Hollywood) would have been 5-10x more than Netflix’s cost of production. This series in particular has opened the floodgates for streaming services to shoot internationally, as many of them are now starting to express interest in it. Squid Games was a huge money maker for Netflix and has been estimated to be worth in the ballpark of $900M, which represents a return on their investment (production) of over 4,100%. Considering Netflix’s revenues last quarter were $7.3B, Squid Games is likely to represent a large percentage of their revenues in Q3, and since their margins are so impressive, it is likely that we see Squid Games have a role to play in Netflix having better margins on their upcoming earnings.  The most important factor that I derived from Netflix’s Q2 2021 financial report is the fact that their weighted average subscription price across all of their regions is $12.26. This will be very important in determining the revenues in Q3 2021. Furthermore, Netflix’s revenues in Q2 2021 were $7.34B, and their cost of revenues was $4.02B (54.73% of revenues).   I am basing Netflix’s revenues off of their previous revenues, plus the new revenues that are brought in by additional subscribers in this quarter. Firstly, to get the new subscriber figures I decided to take Netflix’s estimate of 3.5M in this quarter for the first 3 months, due to squid games not being added. This resulted in 900k new subscribers per month for the first 3 months, which adds up to 2.7M new subscribers in June, July, and August. Lastly, we needed the new subscribers for the month of September. This was more difficult to calculate as they released Squid Games this month which drove in far more traffic than usual.
